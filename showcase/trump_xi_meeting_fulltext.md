By Kim Seung-yeon

GYEONGJU, South Korea, Nov. 1 (Yonhap) -- The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit began its concluding session Saturday, as world leaders seek to forge consensus on free trade and multilateralism.

This year's APEC forum, hosted by South Korea, is taking place amid the ongoing tit-for-tat trade war between the United States and China, with Washington downplaying free trade under its "America First" policy, while Beijing has assumed what was once the U.S. role of championing it.

The 21 APEC member economies include the U.S., China, Japan, Russia, Canada, and others in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, as well as Peru and Chile.

Saturday's final session, titled "Preparing a Future-Ready Asia-Pacific," focused on artificial intelligence (AI) and demographic changes -- the two initiatives pushed for by South Korea.

President Lee Jae Myung called for finding "creative solutions" to better embrace the era of AI and aging society, proposing an AI initiative for policy exchanges and tackling the AI divide.

"The foremost principle is to build an AI-driven society where technological innovation fosters inclusive growth, 'the AI for all,'" Lee said in the opening remark.

"South Korea's AI Initiative is the result of our firm determination to seize this great wave of change driven by the AI and turn it into an opportunity for us," Lee said.

Lee proposed establishing an "Asia-Pacific AI center" to boost AI capabilities in the region.

To better address demographic changes, Lee proposed a "joint framework" to respond to challenges stemming from the decreasing population.

South Korea plans to produce an outcome endorsed by all APEC participants in a written joint declaration, or the envisioned "Gyeongju Declaration," and put the spotlight on its own initiatives, such as artificial intelligence and demographic changes.

The two-day gathering has focused on ways to strengthen economic resilience and spur growth amid uncertainties driven by a growing tide of protectionism.

Taking center stage at Friday's first session of the APEC summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for safeguarding multilateral trading system, proposing creating an "Asia-Pacific community," in the face of growing uncertainties.

Drawing attention is whether and to what extent the leaders will reach a consensus on charting the path for international trade, as they hold differing views on the global free trade order underpinned by multilateralism and the World Trade Organization (WTO) system.

Most of the APEC economies have endorsed WTO-based free trade system in their joint declarations in the past few years.

Between 2021 and 2024, all APEC summit declarations included mention of a rules-based multilateral trading system with the WTO "at its core," which first appeared in the 2021 declaration, after Trump's first term ended.

The APEC leaders' declaration can only be adopted by consensus, with support from every single member economy.

A separate statement from the APEC Ministerial Meeting will also be released, detailing efforts to expand cooperation in various sectors.

Following the main session, Lee will formally hand over the APEC chairmanship to Xi in a ceremony. China is the host for next year's APEC.

Lee will later join the rest of his visiting counterparts for a group photo.

Lee will then hold a press conference to explain the outcome of the summit.

After the summit wraps up, Lee is scheduled to hold his first bilateral meeting with Xi, which will be followed by a dinner banquet.

## 2. 'If they're going to do it ... ': Trump doubles down on nuclear testing plan; underground tests on cards? - The Times of India

**Full Text:**

US President Donald Trump on Friday reaffirmed that the US would resume nuclear testing, following his announcement this week that he was directing the Pentagon to restart the weapons tests.While talking with reporters on Air Force One in midair, Trump gave an indirect answer when asked whether he would include the traditional underground nuclear tests that were common during the Cold War. "You'll find out very soon. But we're going to do some testing, yeah," Trump said on Air Force One. "Other countries do it. If they're going to do it, we're going to do it. I'm not going to say here."On Wednesday, Trump directed the Pentagon to immediately begin testing US nuclear weapons on an equal basis to China and Russia. "The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country," the President wrote in a Truth Social post. "This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office. Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice! Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years."Also Read: 'Because of other countries ... ': Trump says US to start nuclear weapons testing; move follows Russia's trialsThe announcement came less than an hour before his highly anticipated meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea on trade. Trump initially ignored a question from a reporter on the announcement during his meeting with Xi, but told reporters afterwards that the news "had to do with others" when asked whether it had to do with Xi. "They seem to all be nuclear testing. We have more nuclear weapons than anybody," the President said. "We don't do testing, and we halted it many years ago, but with others doing testing, I think it's appropriate that we do also," he continued. North Korea is the only country that has carried out nuclear testing since the 1990s. Russia has been testing nuclear-capable weapons, which does not include setting off actual bombs. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been testing missiles capable of having nuclear warheads as recently as this week.Why the US stopped testing nuclear bombs? The United States conducted 1,054 nuclear tests between 1945 and 1992, most of them in Nevada, before halting amid growing environmental concerns and Cold War fatigue.During the 1950s, above-ground tests escalated tensions with the Soviet Union. President Eisenhower announced a pause in testing in 1958, assuming the Soviet Union would reciprocate, Axios reported.When the Soviets resumed tests in 1961, the US followed suit. In 1963, the US, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union signed the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty to end tests in the atmosphere, outer space and underwater, driven by environmental concerns and fallout from the Cuban Missile Crisis.The Threshold Test Ban Treaty of 1974 limited underground tests to yields below 150 kilotons. In 1992, Congress passed a resolution prohibiting underground nuclear tests unless another state conducted one, establishing the current moratorium. President Clinton signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1997, but the Senate rejected ratification on national security grounds. Globally, as of August 2025, 187 state parties have signed the CTBT and 178 have ratified it.What it means for the US?The US has signed -- but not ratified -- the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, leaving President Trump free under law to resume nuclear testing. His announcement has revived painful memories of the Cold War era, when open-air detonations sickened thousands across the American West. Lawmakers from Nevada, which hosted hundreds of tests, condemned the plan as both a public health hazard and a geopolitical provocation that could "lead to World War III," Politico reported.Experts argue there's no technical need for renewed testing, noting the US already certifies its nuclear arsenal as safe through advanced simulations and experiments. Each new test could cost $140 million and risk reigniting global tensions. Trump allies, however, claim testing would project strength to China and Russia. Analysts warn such a move could alienate US allies, undermine nuclear restraint, and spark a new arms race just as key arms control treaties near expiration.

## 3. South Korea to woo China's Xi with state visit as APEC wraps up

GYEONGJU, South Korea (Reuters) -Chinese President Xi Jinping will wrap up his three-day visit to South Korea on Saturday with a state visit hosted by President Lee Jae Myung, the newly elected U.S. ally who has pledged to balance Seoul's ties with Beijing.

The stakes are high for Lee who assumed office in June following the ouster of his hawkish predecessor over a failed attempt to impose martial law. Lee faces the dual challenge of protecting South Korea's export-driven economy and lowering tensions with North Korea amid rising China-U.S. competition.

Earlier this week, Lee also hosted U.S. President Donald Trump for a rushed state visit, showering him with gifts and praise before announcing a surprise trade deal aimed at lowering U.S. tariffs in return for billions of dollars in South Korean investment in the United States.

The South Korean president is set to hold similar events for Xi on Saturday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Gyeongju, including a summit meeting and state dinner. It is the first time in 11 years that Xi has visited South Korea.

Xi also met with Trump on Thursday ahead of the APEC summit, striking a deal that includes lower U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods in exchange for Beijing's crackdown on illicit fentanyl trade, the resumption of U.S. soybean purchases and continued flow of rare earths exports. The Chinese president held talks with the leaders of Japan, Canada, and Thailand as well.

Lee's office has said that he and Xi will discuss the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, a diplomatic phrase used to refer to North Korea's nuclear weapons, which are banned by United Nations Security Council resolutions.

In response, Pyongyang, a military and economic ally of China, dismissed the denuclearisation agenda as an unrealisable "pipe dream."

Trump had offered to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his visit to South Korea, but Pyongyang did not issue a public response.

Seoul is a key U.S. military ally in Asia, hosting thousands of American troops and relying on the U.S. nuclear umbrella for protection from nuclear-armed North Korea.

Yet its economy is heavily reliant on not just the U.S., which has been imposing tariffs and pushing for investment to offset trade imbalances, but also China, which has grown increasingly challenging for South Korean companies and wields influence over North Korea.

CHARM OFFENSIVE?

As Trump skipped this week's APEC leaders' summit, Beijing positioned itself as the predictable champion of free and open trade, a role the U.S. has dominated for decades.

John Delury, senior fellow at the Asia Society, said China has yet to launch a charm offensive toward U.S. allies like South Korea, amid pressure from Trump's tariffs and uncertainty over U.S. military commitments.

"I think Beijing is in a phase one approach where they are sitting back a little bit and letting the Trump administration do damage on its own," he said.

"We have not seen China launching big charm offensives to try to capitalize on some of that damage," he added.

A second phase could include more outreach, but it could also see Beijing ramp up pressure of its own, he said.

South Korea has voiced concerns about the impact of China's controls on rare earth exports and called for the swift removal of Chinese sanctions on five U.S.-linked units of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean. Beijing said the sanctions were related to security risks stemming from the company's cooperation with U.S. investigations.

Seoul is also hoping that Xi's visit may lead to Beijing relaxing years-long restrictions on South Korean entertainment content, effectively banned after the 2017 deployment of the U.S.-led Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defence system in South Korea.

South Korea has also expressed concerns over structures placed in disputed waters between the two countries, which China claims are for fishing purposes.

An APEC official told Reuters on Friday that member states were "working around the clock" to negotiate a joint declaration on free trade.

## 4. Trump efforts to help US coal undercut by export drop during trade war

**Full Text:**

FORT COLLINS, Colo -- President Donald Trump's efforts to help the U.S. coal industry at home are being undermined by falling sales abroad amid his trade war with China, new government reports show.

China has stopped importing U.S. coal, accounting for most of a 14% decline in U.S. coal exports so far this year, according to analysts and the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Trump's meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping this week suggests trade progress. But whether it will include the U.S. coal industry is still uncertain.

"It's hard to tell whether that's just going to maintain the status quo or if that's going to be an increase in exports of coal and soybeans to China," coal analyst Seth Feaster with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said Friday.

Trump has been easing up on regulations and opening up mining on federal lands. The result has been to "keep our lights on, our economy strong, and America Energy Dominant," Interior Department spokesperson Charlotte Taylor said in an e-mailed statement Friday.

The administration has also reduced royalty rates for coal extracted from federal lands and in September pledged $625 million to bolster coal power generation, including by recommissioning or modernizing old coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

Recent government coal lease sales in Montana, Wyoming and Utah, however, have failed to draw bids deemed acceptable by the Interior Department.

So far this year, U.S. coal production is up about 6%, due not to Trump policies but higher natural gas prices, Feaster said.

Meanwhile, coal exports fell 14% from January through September compared to the same time last year, according to an EIA report released Oct. 7.

The drop followed an additional Chinese tariff of 15% on U.S. coal in February and a 34% reciprocal Chinese tariff on imports from the U.S. in April, the EIA said in a report issued Friday.

The U.S. exports about one-fifth of the coal it produces. Most goes to India, the Netherlands, Japan, Brazil and South Korea.

China is not a top destination, taking in only about one-tenth of U.S. coal exports. But it has had an outsized effect on overall U.S. coal exports by halting all coal from the U.S. since April, said Andy Blumenfeld, a coal analyst at McCloskey by OPIS.

Almost three-quarters of U.S. coal exported to China last year was metallurgical coal used in steelmaking. The rest was thermal coal burned in power plants to produce electricity, according to Blumenfeld.

Nearly all U.S. metallurgical coal is mined in Appalachia, while the bulk of U.S. thermal coal comes from massive, open-pit mines in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana.

Appalachia would therefore benefit most from a resumption of U.S. coal exports to China, noted Blumenfeld by email.

"There is optimism," Blumenfeld wrote. "But there is little documentation to back that up right now."

Most coal headed for China last year went through Baltimore, with lesser amounts via the Norfolk, Virginia, area and Gulf of Mexico, according to Blumenfeld.

Relatively little thermal coal from the Western U.S. is exported due to the cost of hauling it by rail to the West Coast, where there has also been political resistance to building port facilities to export more coal.

## 5. APEC summit to close in South Korea after Trump, Xi agreed on trade truce

**Full Text:**

GYEONGJU, South Korea -- Leaders of 21 Asian and Pacific Rim nations are to set to wrap up their annual economic forum on Saturday after President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed on a temporary truce on their trade war, generating relief around the world.

This year's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in the South Korean city of Gyeongju was heavily overshadowed by Thursday's Trump-Xi meeting that ended with the two leaders dialing back their earlier trade steps and de-escalating their trade tensions.

The high-stakes meeting was arranged on the sidelines of APEC. Trump, known for his dismissal of multilateralism, quickly left South Korea after reaching deals with Xi, allowing the Chinese president to steal the limelight at the summit.

During the APEC summit's opening session Friday, Xi said China would support global free trade and supply chain stability in an apparent effort to position his country as an alternative to Trump's protectionist policies. In written remarks sent to a CEO summit held in conjunction with APEC, Xi said that "Investing in China is investing in the future."

Xi met his Japanese, Canadian and Thai counterparts bilaterally on the sidelines of APEC on Friday. He's to meet South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Saturday for talks that Seoul officials said would touch on efforts to achieve denuclearization and peace on the Korean Peninsula.

That agenda at the Xi-Lee meeting angered North Korea, a non-APEC member. North Korea's Vice Foreign Minister Pak Myong Ho on Saturday slammed South Korea for talking about "its daydream" of realizing North Korea's denuclearization, saying North Korea will show how such a push is "a pipedream" that can never be realized. Park's statement was seen as applying pressure on both South Korea and China ahead of their bilateral summit.

Trump earlier repeatedly expressed his desire to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong U n during his visit to South Korea, but North Korea hasn't responded. Trump and Kim met three times in 2018-19, but their nuclear diplomacy eventually collapsed. North Korea has since vowed not to place its advancing nuclear program on a negotiating table, but experts say the North would aim for winning extensive sanctions relief in return for a partial surrender of its advancing nuclear program.

Friday's APEC meeting focused on ways to boost trade and investment, and Saturday's meeting is expected to center on artificial intelligence, demographic challenges and new growth strategies.

As the host nation, South Korea has been prodding members to adopt a joint declaration at the end of APEC's second and final day session on Saturday. In a 2018 APEC summit in Papua New Guinea, members failed to come up with a joint declaration due to U.S.-China discord over trade.

South Korean officials earlier said that issuing a joint statement strongly endorsing free trade would be unlikely because of differing positions among APEC members

Established in 1989, APEC champions free and open trade and investment to accelerate regional economic integration. But the APEC region now faces challenges like strategic rivalry between the U.S. and China, supply chain disruptions, aging populations and the impact of AI on jobs.

The U.S. strategy has been shifted to economic competitions with China rather than cooperation, with Trump's tariff hikes and "America first" agenda shaking markets and threatening decades of globalization and multinationalism.

Chinese President Xi Jinping is set to meet his South Korean counterpart, Lee Jae Myung, on Saturday, as both countries seek closer ties amid Seoul's sprawling relationship with the US.

The Xi-Lee talks will be held on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) Summit. It will follow the talks both leaders had with US President Donald Trump earlier this week. Both Xi and Lee discussed ways to improve their respective relationships with Washington as they met Trump.

## 8. APEC summit draws to close as leaders strive for consensus on free trade

The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit was set to close Saturday after a whirlwind of high-stakes diplomacy, with attention focused on whether the leaders of major economies can forge consensus on free trade and multilateralism.

The two-day gathering of 21 APEC member economies, joined by international organizations, has focused on ways to strengthen economic resilience and spur growth amid uncertainties driven by a growing tide of protectionism.

Donald Trump signals possible US resumption of nuclear tests, citing threats from China and Russia, ending a ban in place since 1992 and raising global concerns.

In a startling policy turn, US President Donald Trump has hinted that the United States may resume underground nuclear weapons tests, something not done since 1992, stating, "We're going to do some testing ... You'll find out very soon."

Speaking from aboard Air Force One while en route to a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea, Trump told reporters the country cannot continue to "play by old rules" while other nations expand their nuclear arsenals.

Earlier this week, Trump posted on his social-media platform that he had ordered the US military to "start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis," citing growing threats from China and Russia.

The announcement has stirred global unease. For more than three decades, the US has adhered to a voluntary moratorium on explosive nuclear tests, last conducted in 1992, and signed the Comprehensive Nuclear Testâ€‘Ban Treaty (CTBT) in 1996, though it has not ratified it.

When asked whether the upcoming tests would be full-scale underground detonations, Trump declined to clarify, stating only "We'll see." US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, speaking in Malaysia, supported the decision as a way to maintain credible deterrence. "Resuming testing is a pretty responsible very responsible way to do that. And I think it makes nuclear conflict less likely," he added.

## 13. Japan PM says raised 'serious concerns' with Xi on South China Sea, Xinjiang

**Full Text:**

GYEONGJU, South Korea -- Japan's new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said on Friday she raised "serious concerns" about the South China Sea, Hong Kong and Xinjiang in her first meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Takaichi, Japan's first woman prime minister, has long been seen as a China hawk and has been a regular visitor to the Yasukuni shrine that honours Japan's war dead, a site that angers China and South Korea.

She said she told Xi at the APEC summit in South Korea that she wanted a "strategic and mutually beneficial relationship between Japan and China".

But she told reporters that she also raised a number of thorny issues with the Chinese leader, saying that it was "important for us to engage in direct, candid dialogue".

"We... expressed serious concerns regarding actions in the South China Sea, as well as the situations in Hong Kong and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region," Takaichi said.

Beijing vehemently denies accusations of human rights abuses against the Uyghurs, saying its policies in Xinjiang have eradicated extremism and boosted development.

China has sweeping assertions of sovereignty over the South China Sea despite an international ruling in 2016 concluding its claims have no legal basis.

Tensions between China and the Philippines -- which, like Japan, is a close US ally -- have been particularly fraught, with frequent maritime confrontations.

Takaichi said she also raised with Xi the Japanese-administered Senkaku islands, known as the Diaoyu in China, in the East China Sea where Japanese and Chinese vessels frequently face off.

She also said she spoke to Xi about export controls on items including rare earths that are vital for a wide range of industries.

Takaichi added that she also pressed for the release of Japanese citizens detained in China and requested that the safety of Japanese expatriates in China be ensured.

"I conveyed that we would like these matters to be addressed," she said.

Takaichi is also a strong backer of Taiwan and supports security cooperation with the self-ruled island that China claims as its territory.

"Regarding Taiwan, there was some discussion from the Chinese side," Takaichi said.

"I stated that for the stability and security in this region, maintaining good cross-strait relations is important," she said.

Around 60,000 US military personnel are based in Japan. Takaichi hosted US President Donald Trump this week, with both making speeches on the deck of an American aircraft carrier.

Takaichi announced last week Japan would be spending two percent of gross domestic product on defence this fiscal year, two years ahead of schedule.

"It could be a frosty get-to-know-you meeting as Xi Jinping has not sent a congratulatory message to Takaichi, wary of her reputation as a China hawk," Yee Kuang Heng, a professor at the University of Tokyo's Graduate School of Public Policy, told AFP before the meeting.

"Overall though, stability is a shared priority," Heng said.

**Full Text:**

The APEC summit concludes after a temporary US-China trade truce, overshadowing discussions on global trade and regional cooperation. President Xi Jinping positions China as a trade leader amidst fading multilateralism, while South Korea's agenda on denuclearization angers North Korea, highlighting geopolitical tensions.

The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit concluded in Gyeongju, South Korea, amidst a significant backdrop: a temporary truce between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on their ongoing trade war. This agreement brought relief to global markets and shifted the summit's focus.

Xi Jinping emphasized China's commitment to global free trade and supply chain stability during APEC's opening session, seeking to position China as a leader in contrast to Trump's protectionist stance. Simultaneously, South Korea's efforts to address denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula sparked ire in North Korea.

As the summit wrapped up, the discussion evolved towards artificial intelligence, demographic changes, and innovative growth strategies. South Korea pushed for a joint declaration supporting free trade, but the proposal was challenged by various members' differing views, reflecting deeper geopolitical fractures.

## 15. Xi delivers veiled warning to nations not to take the US' side

**Full Text:**

At an Asia-Pacific summit, China's Xi Jinping urged nations to boost trade and investment, implicitly cautioning against reducing reliance on Chinese supply chains. He championed "extending chains" over "breaking chains," while also condemning protectionism and "unilateral bullying." This comes after China's recent rare earth export control proposal, which raised global concerns.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping, the de facto geopolitical heavyweight at an Asia-Pacific economic summit, on Friday courted countries for trade and investment, but also implicitly warned them not to join the United States in reducing the world's reliance on Chinese supply chains.

President Donald Trump's departure from South Korea a day earlier meant that Xi was the sole superpower leader at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in the city of Gyeongju. At the opening of the meeting, Xi could be seen smiling and shaking hands with world leaders and economic and finance ministers who came up to greet him.

Xi seized his time in the spotlight to pitch China, the world's second-largest economy and a manufacturing powerhouse, to a room that included the leaders of Japan, Canada, Australia and the host, South Korea. (But not everyone in the room was an easy sell.)

He met with Prime Minister Mark Carney, recently spurned by Trump, and invited him to visit China. He even had what sounded like a candid meeting with Japan's new leader, Sanae Takaichi, an outspoken critic of China, who appeared to show the limits of Xi's outreach.

Earlier, in a speech at the opening of the summit, Xi called for the strengthening of industrial supply chains, making a veiled criticism of attempts by the West to shift factories away from a dependence on China. He said China would "adhere to the principle of 'joining hands' rather than 'letting go,' and 'extending chains' rather than 'breaking chains.'"

In a separate speech to business leaders that was read out by a Chinese representative, Xi also took an indirect swipe at the United States, saying APEC economies should "oppose protectionism, resist unilateral bullying and prevent the world from returning to the law of the jungle."

That appeal for solidarity, however, was somewhat undercut by China's recent actions. In October, China proposed sweeping new export controls on rare earth minerals that would have given Beijing extraordinary power over other nations. China dominates about 90% of the world's supply of the minerals, which are vital for the production of virtually all modern technologies like semiconductors, batteries and jets.

China had introduced those rare earth controls in response to U.S. trade measures, but the moves drew alarm in other countries.

Xi was arriving at the regional summit on something of a diplomatic high, a day after talks with Trump that resulted in a truce, and, importantly, China had agreed to put on hold the new export controls on rare earths. Trump left the talks almost effusive with praise for Xi, effectively bolstering Xi's argument that he is a steady hand seeking stability.

On Friday, though, Xi may have met a more openly critical interlocutor in Japan's new prime minister. Takaichi told reporters that she raised Japan's concerns about the export controls on rare earths, territorial disputes in the East China Sea and the detention of Japanese nationals in China on espionage charges.

She said she had expressed "serious concerns" about China's militarization of the South China Sea and about human rights abuses in Hong Kong and the Xinjiang region.

"It is true that there are outstanding issues and differences of opinion," Takaichi said, "but that is why it is important that we speak directly and frankly."

Dylan Loh, an associate professor of public policy and global affairs at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, said that China's rare earth controls were "an exercise of geopolitical leverage in the context of the U.S.-China economic conflict, which will have not gone unnoticed."

Song Guoyou, an expert on U.S.-China economic relations at Fudan University in Shanghai, defended China's rare earths export regime as a necessary response to U.S. tariffs on China and restrictions on American technology.

"These actions have destabilized the regional flow of trade and production," Song said. "This is precisely why China is calling for joint efforts to maintain the stability and smooth operation of these chains."

Xi's remarks on supply chains, Song continued, were a way to urge governments not to follow in the United States' footsteps in using tariffs, imposing export restrictions and making excessive appeals for national economic security.

"Was the stability of the rare earth supply chain a concern for most regional members before?" Song said. "Clearly not. So when did it become an issue? It arose after the United States continuously imposed trade suppression and export controls on China."

Xi's meeting with Trump on Thursday in Busan, a city roughly 50 miles south of Gyeongju, resulted in a reduction in some U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, a suspension of port fees on Chinese ships and the delay of U.S. export controls that would have prevented more Chinese companies from acquiring American technology.

In return, China agreed to restart purchases of American soybeans and pause its new export controls on rare earths. The United States said China also agreed to do more to curb the flow of precursor chemicals used in making fentanyl.

Loh noted that Xi used the forum to promote "practical cooperation" in the region that would have included China.

Xi pointed to the Belt and Road, a Chinese global infrastructure project, and two trade agreements, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. Such pacts would help China counter U.S. efforts to cut Chinese companies out of trade.

Many regional countries find themselves caught between the demands of Washington and Beijing. Their best bet is often to improve ties with both sides in the hopes of extracting more benefits, analysts said.

In just the last week, Trump signed trade deals with Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Malaysia, while China enhanced its trade pact with a Southeast Asian group of 11 countries.

"It's a question of Southeast Asian countries doing what they always do: Make whatever accommodations are needed to ensure robust relations with both the United States and China," said Stephen Olson, a former U.S. trade negotiator who is now a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore.

## 16. Pentagon chief joins Southeast Asian meet to shore up US ties - Asia & Pacific - The Jakarta Post

**Full Text:**

nited States Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was expected on Friday to hold two-way meetings in Malaysia during a gathering of Southeast Asian counterparts, as Washington seeks to strengthen security ties amid China's growing assertiveness in the region.

Hegseth is expected to meet defense ministers from India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, among others, said an official speaking on condition of anonymity, who warned the schedule could change.

It was not clear if the Pentagon chief would meet any Chinese officials while in the Malaysian capital for the two-day meeting.

In his meeting with Indian defense minister Rajnath Singh, Hegseth was expected to discuss a review of India's plans to buy US military hardware, as well as a new India-US defense cooperation framework.

Delegations from Australia, China, New Zealand, South Korea and Russia are also attending the meeting of defense ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

Chinese grey-zone tactics

Hegseth met Malaysia's defense minister on Thursday and both leaders committed to maritime security in the disputed South China Sea.

Beijing has deployed a coast guard armada in the busy waterway that has clashed repeatedly with Philippine vessels and been accused of disrupting the energy activities of Malaysia and Vietnam.

"Grey-zone tactics, such as hydrographic research conducted under the protection of foreign coast guard vessels, threaten sovereignty and are a clear provocation and threat," Malaysian Defense Minister Mohamed Khaled Nordin said in a joint statement.

China claims almost the entire South China Sea on its maps, overlapping with the exclusive economic zones of Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam.

Unresolved disputes have festered for years over the sovereignty of multiple islands and features.

Beijing says its coastguard has operated professionally in defending Chinese territory from incursions.

The US has sought to shore up its presence in Southeast Asia and counter the growing influence of China.

On Sunday, President Donald Trump told ASEAN leaders the US was "with you 100% and we intend to be a strong partner for many generations".

Washington has a defense pact with the Philippines that involves dozens of annual military drills and use of some of its bases, in addition to similar exercises with Thailand and Indonesia and exchanges with Malaysia.

Order to resume nuclear testing

Shortly before meeting Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Thursday, Trump said he had ordered the US military to resume nuclear weapons testing amid a rapid expansion of China's nuclear stockpile.

His administration's efforts to persuade its allies to spend more on defense have caused friction, but Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi told Trump this week that she was determined to boost defense capabilities.

On Wednesday, Hegseth urged Japan to hasten plans to boost defense spending to 2 percent of GDP, saying the alliance between Washington and Tokyo was "critical to deterring Chinese military aggression".

## 17. US strategy of regime change over, focus now on stability: Tulsi Gabbard

The US national intelligence director told officials Friday in the Mideast that America's former strategy of regime change or nation building had ended under President Donald Trump.

Tulsi Gabbard 's comments before the Manama Dialogue, an annual security summit in Bahrain put on by the International Institute for Security Studies, underlines remarks Trump offered on a trip earlier this year to the Middle East.

In Trump's second term, previous American goals of fostering human rights and democracy promotion in the region have been replaced by an emphasis on economic prosperity and regional stability.

That includes securing a ceasefire that has halted the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, as well as forcing an end to Israel's 12-day war on Iran after sending American bombers to attack Iranian nuclear sites.

For decades, our foreign policy has been trapped in a counterproductive and endless cycle of regime change or nation building, said Gabbard, a former Congresswoman from Hawaii and US Army National Guard veteran.

It was a one-size-fits-all approach, of toppling regimes, trying to impose our system of governance on others, intervene in conflicts that were barely understood and walk away with more enemies than allies.

She added: The results: Trillions spent, countless lives lost and in many cases, the creation of greater security threats.

That assessment mirrors Trump's own thinking about the wars that followed the September 11, 2001, terror attacks on New York and Washington.

He reached a deal in his first term to withdraw from Afghanistan, which in the Biden administration became a chaotic departure in 2021. Meanwhile, he's embraced Syria's interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former al-Qaida fighter once held in an American prison in Iraq.

But serious challenges remain, particularly in the Middle East. Gabbard noted in her brief remarks that the ceasefire in Gaza remained fragile. She also acknowledged Iran remained a concern as the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said renewed movement has been detected recently at the country's nuclear sites.

The road ahead will not be simple or easy but the president is very committed down this road, said Gabbard, who attended the event as a government shutdown grinds on back home.

An Associated Press journalist had been accredited and issued a visa to cover the summit, but the Bahraini government late Wednesday said it had been rescinded as it was conducting a post-approval review of that permission.

The government did not elaborate on why the visa was revoked. Earlier that day, the AP published a story on long-detained activist Abdulhadi al-Khawaja beginning an open-ended hunger strike in Bahrain over his internationally criticised imprisonment.

Deal between the US and China is undoing damage from a self-inflicted trade war

BUSAN, South Korea (AP) -- After months of posturing, arguing and threatening, U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have essentially turned back the clock. While the meeting between the two leaders was hailed by Trump as a "roaring success," the agreement that came out of it may only serve to undo some of the damages Trump inflicted with his trade war upon his return to the White House. Nevertheless, the deal has injected a degree of stability, giving the world's two largest economies -- as well as the rest of the world -- time and room to readjust.

Chinese President Xi Jinping attends the first session of the 32nd Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders' Meeting and delivers a speech titled "Building an Inclusive Open Asia-Pacific Economy for All" in Gyeongju, South Korea, Oct. 31, 2025. (Xinhua/Huang Jingwen)

Amid the hum of conversation and click of cameras, APEC leaders met in Gyeongju, South Korea on Friday to discuss the world economy. Taking the stage, Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a clear message: China will open its door wider and create new opportunities for the Asia-Pacific and the world at large.

Amid rising protectionism, Xi told the APEC audience that China always pursues the basic state policy of opening up and has taken real steps to promote an open world economy.

The Chinese president noted China's zero-tariff treatment on 100 percent tariff lines from the least developed countries having diplomatic relations with China, and pledged to extend the same treatment to all African countries maintaining such ties.

"China's door to the world will not close; it will only open wider and wider," Xi said.

This message resonated with observers. "This has sent a good signal to the rest of the world," said William Jones, an international relations expert and former White House correspondent for U.S. publication Executive Intelligence Review.

"It has also created enormous optimism in the Global South -- the more trade and development they can have with China, the better," he added.

New opportunities

Xi's South Korea tour is his first overseas trip after presiding over the fourth plenary session of the 20th Communist Party of China Central Committee, which adopted a landmark document -- the Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan -- mapping out China's development path through 2030.

Reform and innovation are defining features of the plan. New initiatives, from strengthening indigenous innovation to rolling out an "AI Plus" initiative to empower industries, are expected to shape China's next stage of growth.

In a written speech to the APEC CEO Summit, Xi highlighted China's five-year plan, saying that China can provide the global business community with more growth opportunities, a good business environment, a vast platform for innovation, and conditions for green growth.

"Investing in China means investing in the future," Xi wrote.

Over the past five years, China has ranked as the world's largest trader in goods and the second largest in services. It has attracted more than 700 billion U.S. dollars in total foreign investment, and its outbound investment has increased by an average of over five percent annually.

Former Slovenian President Danilo Turk said that the long-term vision embedded in China's five-year plan brings stability to China's own development and to the world economy at large. "New and green technologies are moving to the center of China's development concept, which has a global impact," he added.

China's new energy vehicle output surged 35.2 percent year-on-year to more than 11.24 million units in the first nine months of 2025, while sales rose 34.9 percent to 11.23 million units, data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers showed.

Lee Hee-sup, secretary-general of the Trilateral Cooperation Secretariat, has also witnessed China's hi-tech and green transformation firsthand.

"During my visits across China, I have deeply felt that under the leadership of President Xi, the country is advancing national strategies focused on digitalization, artificial intelligence, green industries and scientific innovation, and vigorously developing new quality productive forces," Lee said.

These efforts are driving economic recovery and sustainable growth in China and beyond -- and they are key to China's ability to lead future global development, he added.

Inclusive Asia-Pacific and beyond

Xi's APEC speech marked his first public remarks following a widely watched meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump one day earlier in Busan, South Korea, during which he shared what he called an important secret behind China's success.

"Over the past seven decades and more, we have been working from generation to generation on the same blueprint to make it a reality," Xi told Trump. "We have no intention to challenge or supplant anyone. Our focus has always been on managing China's own affairs well, improving ourselves, and sharing development opportunities with all countries across the world."

In his APEC speech, Xi put forward a five-point proposal to promote a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization and to build an Asia-Pacific community.

The Chinese leader also voiced support for multilateralism and stressed the need to ensure stable supply chains.

"President Xi, in his speech, has laid out the most critical underpinnings that will drive economic progress in the Asia-Pacific region," said Lawrence Loh, professor of the National University of Singapore.

"Without adherence to the multilateral and open economic systems, it will be difficult to build a unified Asia-Pacific Community that will benefit the region and the world," he added.

Chairing Friday's meeting, South Korean President Lee Jae-myung also called for greater cooperation and solidarity among the region to overcome new challenges as the world is at a major turning point.

"We can join together for the ultimate goal of shared prosperity," Lee said.

Julia Roknifard, a senior lecturer at Taylor's University, said APEC has led the region to the forefront of global open development, helping make the Asia-Pacific the most dynamic region in the world economy.

"President Xi is correct in his observation that this region will continue to drive global economic activities for many decades to come," she said.

**Full Text:**

The dollar index (DXY00) climbed to a 2.75-month high on Thursday and finished up by +0.29%. Higher T-note yields on Thursday were positive for the dollar as the 10-year T-note yield rose to a 2.5-week high. The dollar also has carryover support from Wednesday on hawkish comments from Fed Chair Powell, who said a rate cut at the December FOMC meeting "is not a foregone conclusion."

The easing of US-Chinese trade tensions is supportive of economic growth prospects after President Trump and President Xi Jinping agreed to extend a tariff truce, roll back export controls, and reduce other trade barriers.

More News from Barchart

The dollar is still under pressure from the ongoing US government shutdown. The longer the shutdown is maintained, the more likely the US economy will suffer and the more likely the Fed will have to cut interest rates.

The markets are discounting a 72% chance that the FOMC will cut the fed funds target range by 25 bp at the next FOMC meeting on December 9-10. The markets are discounting an overall 82 bp rate cut by the end of 2026 to 3.06% from the current effective federal funds rate of 3.88%.

EUR/USD (^EURUSD) fell to a 2-week low on Thursday and finished down by -0.32%. The dollar's strength on Thursday weighed on the euro. The euro recovered from its worst level after the ECB kept interest rates unchanged following Thursday's policy meeting. Also, Thursday's stronger-than-expected Eurozone Q3 GDP report and German Oct CPI report were hawkish for ECB policy and positive for the euro. In addition, upbeat comments from ECB President Lagarde were bullish for the euro when she said downside risks to growth have eased.

Central bank divergence is supporting the euro, with the ECB seen as finished with its rate-cut cycle while the Fed is expected to cut rates by at least another percentage point by the end of 2026.

Eurozone Q3 GDP rose +0.2% q/q and +1.3% y/y, stronger than expectations of +0.1% q/q and +1.2% y/y.

The Eurozone Oct economic sentiment indicator rose by 1.2 to a 2.5-year high of 96.8, beating expectations of 96.0.

German Oct CPI (EU harmonized) rose +0.3% m/m and +2.3% y/y, stronger than expectations of +0.2% m/m and +2.2% y/y.

As expected, the ECB kept its deposit facility rate unchanged at 2.00%.

## 21. Oil prices steady as investors assess US-China trade truce

**Full Text:**

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices held steady on Thursday as investors assessed a potential trade truce between the United States and China after U.S. President Donald Trump lowered tariffs on China following a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea. Brent futures rose 8 cents, or 0.1%, to settle at $65.00 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 9 cents, or 0.1%, to settle at $60.57. Trump agreed to reduce tariffs on China to 47% from 57% in a one-year deal in exchange for Beijing resuming U.S. soybean purchases, keeping rare earths exports flowing and cracking down on the illicit fentanyl trade. PVM analyst Tamas Varga said investors see the announced agreement between China and the U.S. as more of a de-escalation of tension than a structural change in the relationship.

Oil majors Shell and TotalEnergies posted quarterly profit falls of 10% and 2% respectively on Thursday, dragged down by lower oil prices, though Shell beat expectations, helped by better trading results in its huge gas division. FED RATE CUT LIFTS ECONOMIC OUTLOOK Also helping to boost the economic outlook, the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered interest rates on Wednesday, in line with market expectations. However, it signalled that it might be the last cut of the year as the ongoing government shutdown threatens data availability. Lower interest rates reduce consumer borrowing costs and could boost economic growth and oil demand. "The Fed's decision underscores a broader turn in its policy cycle - one that favours gradual reflation and support over restraint, providing a tailwind to commodities sensitive to economic activity," Rystad Energy's chief economist Claudio Galimberti said in a note. In Europe and Asia, meanwhile, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan kept interest rates unchanged. The euro zone economy grew a touch more quickly than expected in the third quarter, lifted by buoyant growth in France and Spain that more than offset faltering exports and persistent struggles in Germany's oversized industrial sector. In Germany, however, gross domestic product stagnated in the third quarter, data showed on Thursday, highlighting the struggle Europe's biggest economy faces in regaining momentum as exports dwindle. OVERSUPPLY CONCERNS Both crude benchmarks were on track to decline by around 3% in October, which would be their third consecutive month of losses following concerns about oversupply. In the U.S., crude output hit a weekly record high of around 13.6 million barrels per day (bpd) last week. Investors said they were looking ahead to an OPEC+ meeting scheduled for November 2, where the alliance will likely announce another 137,000 bpd supply hike for December. OPEC+ includes the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies like Russia. In a series of monthly increases, eight OPEC+ members had boosted output targets by a total of more than 2.7 million bpd - or about 2.5% of global supply. In Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, the budget deficit widened to 88.5 billion riyals ($23.60 billion) in the third quarter, a 160% rise from the previous quarter as spending increased and revenues fell, the finance ministry said on Thursday.

Judges order Trump administration to use emergency reserves for SNAP payments during the shutdown

BOSTON (AP) -- Two federal judges ruled nearly simultaneously on Friday that President Donald Trump's administration must continue to pay for SNAP, the nation's biggest food aid program, using emergency reserve funds during the government shutdown.

The judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island gave the administration leeway on whether to fund the program partially or in full for November. That also brings uncertainty about how things will unfold and will delay payments for many beneficiaries whose cards would normally be recharged early in the month.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program starting Nov. 1 because it said it could no longer keep funding it due to the shutdown. The program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and is a major piece of the nation's social safety net. It costs about $8 billion per month nationally.

U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat and the ranking member of the Senate Agriculture committee that oversees the food aid program, said Friday's rulings from judges nominated to the bench by former President Barack Obama confirm what Democrats have been saying: "The administration is choosing not to feed Americans in need, despite knowing that it is legally required to do so."

Trump posted on social media Friday blasting congressional Democrats for the shutdown and suggesting the government would comply with the rulings but also that it needed more clarity first: "If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding."

Trump says Senate should scrap the filibuster to end the government shutdown

WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Donald Trump is calling on the Senate to scrap the filibuster, so that the Republican majority can bypass Democrats and reopen the federal government.

"THE CHOICE IS CLEAR -- INITIATE THE 'NUCLEAR OPTION,' GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER," Trump posted Thursday night on his social media site, Truth Social.

The filibuster is a long-standing tactic in the Senate to delay or block votes on legislation by keeping the debate running. It requires 60 votes in a full Senate to overcome a filibuster, giving Democrats a check on the 53-seat Republican majority that led to the start of the Oct. 1 shutdown when the new fiscal year began.

Trump's call to terminate the filibuster could alter the ways the Senate and congressional dealmaking operate, with the president saying in his post that he gave a "great deal" of thought to the choice on his flight back from Asia on Thursday.

Trump spent the past week with foreign leaders in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, finishing his tour by meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

Unidentified remains of 3 people transferred to Israel, Red Cross says

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- The Red Cross said it transferred the unidentified remains of three people to Israel late Friday but they were still being examined and may not be those of missing hostages, an Israeli military official said.

The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak to the media, said the remains had earlier been turned over to the Red Cross by Hamas in Gaza.

The handover follows Israel's return Friday of the bodies of 30 Palestinians to authorities in Gaza. That completed an exchange after militants turned over remains of two hostages, in a sign that the tense Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement is edging forward.

The incremental progress came despite Israeli strikes on Gaza this week that killed more than 100 people following the killing of an Israeli soldier.

The bodies were also transferred with the Red Cross serving as intermediary. The return of the Palestinian remains was confirmed by a doctor at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, where medical workers were striving to identify them.

Multiple people have been arrested in Michigan in a Halloween weekend attack plot, FBI director says

DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Multiple people who had been allegedly plotting a violent attack over the Halloween weekend were arrested Friday in Michigan, FBI Director Kash Patel said in a social media post.

The law enforcement effort was focused on suburban Detroit. Patel said more information would be released later.

Investigators believe the plot was inspired by Islamic State extremism and are investigating whether those in custody were potentially radicalized online, according to two people briefed on the investigation who could not publicly discuss details. They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

FBI and state police vehicles were in a neighborhood near Fordson High School in Dearborn. People wearing shirts marked FBI walked in and out of a house, including one person who collected paper bags and other items from an evidence truck.

Police in Inkster, another suburb, said FBI personnel were at a storage facility there.

Trump declines to clarify if the US will conduct tests of its nuclear weapons

ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) -- President Donald Trump declined to say Friday whether he plans to resume underground nuclear detonation tests, as he had seemed to suggest in a social media post this week that raised concerns the U.S. would begin testing nuclear weapons for the first time in three decades.

The president told reporters "You'll find out very soon," without elaborating when asked if he means to resume underground nuclear detonation tests.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth offered few details on Friday when asked about what nuclear testing the Pentagon would oversee. But he seemed to indicate to reporters that the intent was to test warheads when he said "resuming testing" would be "pretty responsible."

Trump, who spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One as he headed to Florida for a weekend stay, said, "We're going to do some testing" and "Other countries do it. If they're going to do it, we're going to" but then refused to offer more details.

His comments on nuclear testing have drawn confusion inside and outside the government when the president seemed to suggest in a brief post that the U.S. would resume nuclear warhead tests on an "equal basis" with Russia and China, whose last known tests were in the 1990s. Some of Trump's comments seemed to refer to testing missiles that would deliver a warhead, rather than the warhead itself. There has been no indication that the U.S. would start detonating warheads.

Royal prerogative: King Charles III banishes Andrew to buttress the House of Windsor's foundations

No one is bigger than the monarchy. Not even the king's brother.

In the end, that reality spelled the end of Andrew's life as a prince of the realm.

As details of Andrew's links to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein continued to dribble out and Parliament raised questions about his rent-free residence at a sprawling country house near Windsor Castle, King Charles III moved Thursday to shield the monarchy from any further revelations.

In a statement issued by Buckingham Palace, the king said he had taken steps to strip his brother of all his titles and honors, including the one he has held since birth -- prince. From now on, the scandal-plagued British royal will be known simply as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.

Andrew is also being forced to move out of Royal Lodge, the 30-room mansion near Windsor Castle where he has lived for more than 20 years.

Militia attack on hospital in Darfur came in waves, WHO says

CAIRO (AP) -- Groups of gunmen who reportedly killed at least 460 people at a hospital in Sudan attacked in several waves, abducting doctors and nurses, then gunning down staff, patients and people sheltering there, the World Health Organization said Friday.

The attack Tuesday in the country's Darfur region was part of a reported rampage by the Rapid Support Forces, a powerful paramilitary group, as it captured the key city of el-Fasher after besieging it for 18 months. Witnesses have reported fighters going house-to-house, killing civilians and committing sexual assaults.

Many details of the hospital attack and other violence in the city have been slow to emerge, and the total death toll remains unknown.

The fall of el-Fasher heralds a new phase of the brutal, two-year war between the RSF and the military in Africa's third-largest country.

The war has killed more than 40,000 people, according to U.N. figures, but aid groups say that is an undercount and the true number could be many times higher. The war has displaced more than 14 million people and fueled outbreaks of diseases believed to have killed thousands. Famine has been declared in parts of Darfur, a region the size of Spain, and other parts of the country.

Ohio panel and Virginia lawmakers move forward with congressional redistricting plans

An Ohio panel adopted new U.S. House districts on Friday that could boost the GOP's chances of winning two additional seats in next year's elections and aid President Donald Trump's efforts to hold on to a slim congressional majority.

The action by the Ohio Redistricting Commission came as Virginia's Democratic-led General Assembly advanced a proposed constitutional amendment that could pave the way for redistricting in the state ahead of the 2026 congressional elections. That measure needs another round of legislative approval early next year before it can go to voters.

Trump has been urging Republican-led states to reshape their U.S. House districts in an attempt to win more seats. But unlike in other states, Ohio's redistricting was required by the state constitution because the current districts were adopted after the 2020 census without bipartisan support.

Ohio joins Texas, Missouri and North Carolina, where Republican lawmakers already have revised congressional districts.

Democrats have been pushing back. California voters are deciding Tuesday on a redistricting plan passed by the Democratic-led Legislature.

Monkey escape in Mississippi gives a glimpse into the secretive world of animal research

The recent escape of several research monkeys after the truck carrying them overturned on a Mississippi interstate is the latest glimpse into the secretive industry of animal research and the processes that allow key details of what happened to be kept from the public.

Three monkeys have remained on the loose since the crash on Tuesday in a rural area along Interstate 59, spilling wooden crates labeled "live monkeys" into the tall grass near the highway. Since then, searchers in masks, face shields and other protective equipment have scoured nearby fields and woods for the missing primates. Five of the 21 Rhesus macaques on board were killed during the search, according to the local sheriff, but it was unclear how that happened.

Mississippi authorities have not disclosed the company involved in transporting the monkeys, where the monkeys were headed or who owns them. While Tulane University in New Orleans has acknowledged that the monkeys had been housed at its National Biomedical Research Center in Covington, Louisiana, it said it doesn't own them and won't identify who does.

An initial report from the sheriff described the monkeys as "aggressive" and carrying diseases such as herpes, adding to the confusion. Tulane later said the monkeys were free of pathogens, but it is still unclear what kind of research the monkeys were used for.

The questions surrounding the Mississippi crash and the mystery of why the animals were traveling through the South are remarkable, animal advocates say.

Amazon carries Wall Street to the finish of another winning week and month

NEW YORK (AP) -- Amazon led the U.S. stock market on Friday to the finish of another winning week and month.

The S&P 500 rose 0.3% and pulled closer to its all-time high set on Tuesday. It closed out a third straight winning week and a sixth straight winning month, its longest monthly winning streak since 2021.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 40 points, or 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.6%.

Amazon led the way and jumped 9.6%. The retail giant was by far the strongest force lifting the market after reporting profit for the latest quarter that blew past analysts' expectations. CEO Andy Jassy said growth for its booming cloud-computing business has accelerated to a pace it hasn't seen since 2022.

Amazon's massive size of roughly $2.4 trillion means its stock movements carry more weight on the S&P 500 than almost any other company's. Without it, the S&P 500 would have been down for the day.

## 23. Trump's Pacific Pivot - OpEd

**Full Text:**

Donald Trump loves to pivot. He is restless, he has some form of attention deficit disorder, and he likes to keep his enemies and adversaries guessing. Sometimes he pivots so many times, as he has on the war in Ukraine, that he completes a full circle with his pirouette.

This week, Trump is pirouetting through Asia. He has abandoned for the moment his efforts to bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table, though negotiations with the Chinese might prove useful in this regard. He has also left Israel and Hamas to work it out among themselves to implement the peace deal in Gaza -- which seems to be in the process of unravelling -- though he stopped off in Doha on the way to Asia to refuel and chat with the Qatari political leadership about regional peace.

Like the last several U.S. presidents, Trump wants to leave behind the problems of the Old World and the mess of the Middle East. Europeans, now being prodded by Trump (and Russia's Vladimir Putin) to spend more on their own defense, are braced for U.S. troop reductions. In the Middle East, Trump has talked about withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria and getting the last American soldiers out of Iraq. The president, or at least some of his advisors, see peace deals in Ukraine and Gaza as opportunities to once again reorient U.S. policy around the Orient.

Now that the Nobel Peace Prize is no longer dangling in front of his face like a carrot, Trump is focused on the foreign policy that matters the most to him: dealing with China. Sure, other Asian issues draw his attention, like a potential fourth meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un and closer cooperation with Japan's new conservative prime minister, Sanae Takaichi. But even here, the Nobel pushes the president forward, just like the donkey who doggedly pursues its unobtainable carrot. Negotiating a deal to end the Korean War -- frozen in armistice for 75 years -- could be another bid to win the prize. And Takaichi has sycophantically offered to nominate Trump just as her predecessor Shinzo Abe did.

But it's China that holds the key to ensuring some measure of economic stability for the United States. Boiled down to a single vulgar economic transaction, Trump needs to buy China's minerals and sell China soybeans. The economic relationship is, of course, more complicated than that -- involving computer chips, TikTok, EVs, and the like -- but minerals and soybeans will be at the heart of any economic deal that comes out of Trump's trip.

Two weeks ago, after a truce in place since the summer, it looked as though the trade war with China was coming back with a vengeance.

In mid-October, China issued export controls on rare earth elements, the class of minerals that appear in a variety of products from phones and windmills to F-35 fighter jets. Even though many countries are trying to develop their own sources of rare earth minerals, China continues to control about 60 percent of production and 90 percent of processing. Now China is using, for the first time, the "foreign direct product rule," which allows the country to regulate any foreign trade that uses the rare earth elements or processes on its list -- even if it's a non-Chinese company engaged in the trade. It's a tactic the United State has long used around semiconductors.

As Gracelin Baskaran of CSIS explains:

Under the measures announced today, foreign firms will now be required to obtain Chinese government approval to export magnets that contain even trace amounts of Chinese-origin rare earth materials -- or that were produced using Chinese mining, processing, or magnet-making technologies. The new licensing framework will apply to foreign-produced rare earth magnets and select semiconductor materials that contain at least 0.1 percent heavy rare earth elements sourced from China.

Trump responded with his usual tactic: more tariffs. He threatened an additional 100 percent tariffs on Chinese products, on top of the 57 percent already in place, plus some tit-for-tat export controls on software.

It's not just rare earth elements. In September, China imported zero soybeans from the United States. That's down from 1.7 million metric tons the year before. American farmers have been hit so hard by Trump's tariffs -- and the reciprocal tariffs that have ensued -- that the president has been considering a $10 billion bailout of the sector. If China resumes importing soybeans, it could lessen the pain and possibly reduce the bailout as well.

So, on the eve of Trump's trip to Asia to attend the latest ASEAN meeting, the stage was set for either a bruising showdown with China or a kiss-and-make-up.

Trump loves quick and bold agreements. Most of his deals, whether it's peace or trade, are big on the headline elements and light on the details. The trade deal Trump's negotiators strong-armed South Korea into making this week is a case in point. Achieved quickly, it's a basically a shakedown. Seoul has to pay about $350 billion to get tariff relief on cars and semiconductors.

U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators, meanwhile, have been hard at work in Malaysia trying to thrash out their own "framework" agreement. Apparently, Trump's 100 percent tariffs are now off the table, and China has promised to make large purchases of soybeans.

There will be "some kind of deferral" on the issue of rare earth minerals, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, which will amount to a year's pause in China's licensing arrangement while they "study" the issue. That will only kick the issue down the road until the next series of export controls and tariffs reignite the bilateral conflict.

The two sides also have prepared a deal on TikTok for the two leaders to sign that will allow the application to function in the United States with majority U.S. stock ownership and an algorithm outside of Chinese control. Trump will likely cut fentanyl-linked tariffs in exchange for China reducing the export of chemicals that go into the production of the drug. And Xi will probably push Trump to clarify his position on Taiwan, and who knows what Trump will say. An off-the-cuff remark about Taiwanese independence or America's military commitment to the island could take on a life of its own and set new parameters for the trilateral relationship.

Taiwan aside, what China really wants is access to the latest high-tech computer chips, the processes for making them, and the software that runs on them. The key bargaining chip is Nvidia's B30A, which can run the latest AI applications. China ultimately wants to make such chips domestically, but for the time being it wants access to what the West is producing. It's the reverse of the rare earth element situation, where the United States ultimately wants to source the mineral domestically but needs access in the meantime.

Whatever the ultimate terms of the agreement, the most important take-away from the Trump-Xi meeting will be the success of China's strategy. Xi didn't kowtow to Trump, and, as a result, Trump has treated him as an equal. That should be a lesson for other countries, even if they don't have the military and economic firepower of a China.

Despite a lot of knee-bending and gushing rhetoric from national leaders, much of the world stubbornly refuses to conform to Trump's wishes. Putin refuses to negotiate a ceasefire in Ukraine. Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro refuses to step down and go into exile. Canada refuses to be the beta to Trump's alpha. Fentanyl producers have refused en masse to wrap up their operations and produce black-market Ozempic instead.

But the most frustrating of Trump's adversaries has been China. Xi Jinping has calmly responded to every Trump move -- tariffs, export restrictions -- with reciprocal moves of his own. China refuses to play the fool with Trump. Its economy is formidable, and it has become the principal trade partner of more than 120 countries. It's military, too, is big league -- or bigly, as Trump likes to say -- second only to what the Pentagon deploys.

Of course, Xi doesn't want a war with the United States. He has to maintain economic growth -- and that requires, at the very least, stable relations with the United States -- or else he's at risk of a palace coup or a popular revolt. The Communist Party's chief source of legitimacy is its capacity to grow the economy. Take that away and China goes the way of the Soviet Union.

But Xi also must demonstrate China's power in the world. This reassures nationalist sentiment within the country, China's allies in the BRICS, and the less powerful participants in its Belt and Road investment consortium.

What Trump and his advisors care about above all is China's challenge to American power. They worry about China's influence in Latin America around the Panama Canal, in Venezuela, through the Belt and Road Initiative. They worry about China's control over mineral resources, and not just rare earth elements. They're concerned about the expansion of Chinese control near its own borders, for instance over the South China Sea. Most of the big-ticket items in the Pentagon budget are designed for an eventual war with China.

So, this latest economic deal means something very different for China and the United States. For China, it's a necessary compromise to maintain economic performance and its business empire abroad.

For Trump, it's an example of his successful mafioso trade policies and further proof that he can go mano a mano with the big boys. But he still expects a showdown at some point in the future. He's not content for the United States to be a junior partner or even first among equals. Trump wants supremacy, full stop. He can overcome a pesky Venezuela or a proud Canada. But China is an entirely different matter.

These trade deals are just necessary accommodations until the United States achieves mineral independence from China. After that, the MAGA crowd wants full decoupling from China, regardless of the economic consequences. And then the path will be clear for the hardliners to push for what they've long dreamed of: a war with the real civilizational enemy, China.

## 24. Markets Weekly Outlook - BoE Meeting in Focus, US Government Shutdown Continues - Action Forex

**Full Text:**

The week draws to a close on a positive note after starting out with a host of risks to consider. However, one by one those risks were navigated and a positive outlook has emerged, for now.

US-China have agreed on some key points of a potential trade deal averting what markets feared may spiral into a new cold war of sorts. The meeting between Trump-Xi Jinping did deliver an outcome and one which was cheered by market participants.

The question now is, will the deal hold and be built upon or will we get another flare up in a few weeks/months?

Next up we had the Federal Reserve meeting which caught market participants by surprise. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell remains defiant and struck a rather hawkish tone to accompany the expected 25 bps rate cut. Stephen Miran of course voted for a 50 bps cut while one Fed member voted for no rate cut at all.

Another sign of the conflicting ideas between policymakers and challenges for the Fed moving forward.

Lastly we can talk about earnings season where 'magnificent 7' companies all provided positive earnings reports and outlooks which has kept the AI boom, well booming.

On Friday, Amazon's shares jumped by 10.6% to a new record high after the online retailer predicted higher quarterly sales than analysts expected, boosted by its cloud division reporting its fastest revenue growth in almost three years.

Meanwhile, Apple's forecast for iPhone sales in the holiday quarter was better than Wall Street predicted, but its CEO, Tim Cook, warned about ongoing supply limitations; the company's stock remained flat.

Finally, Nvidia rose 1.6% after its CEO, Jensen Huang, expressed hope that the company's most advanced Blackwell chips could be sold in China, building on the momentum that made Nvidia the first publicly listed company to exceed $5 trillion in market value earlier in the week

The US Dollar benefitted from the hawkish outlook by the Federal Reserve which led to the USD rising to a two-month high.

Looking at Friday, the Japanese yen is heading for its worst monthly loss since July against the US Dollar. This happened because the Bank of Japan disappointed traders who were hoping for clearer hints about future interest rate increases, while the US Federal Reserve also lowered expectations for a rate cut in December.

As the yen fell, the US Dollar Index rose 0.35% and is set for its best month since July, with a 2% gain. Meanwhile, the Euro dropped 0.37% after the European Central Bank kept its interest rates steady and stated that policy was in a "good place." The Euro has now lost 1.8% this month due to the Dollar's broad strength.

Finally, the British pound fell to its lowest point since April against the Dollar and hit its weakest against the Euro since May 2023, due to increasing political pressure on British Finance Minister Rachel Reeves.

The week ahead will not be as busy as the one just concluded but there are still some high impact data releases and geopolitical risk.

Beyond the data, markets will keep a close eye on Russia-Ukraine as well the a potential move by the US in Venezuela. President Trump on Friday pushed back on reports that he had given the greenlight for the US to conduct strikes on Venezuelan soil.

If such a move does materialize or if the situation escalates, we could see a rise in risk premium once more just as it appeared to be subsiding.

US earnings will also be key as more companies are scheduled to report next week.

Asia Pacific Markets

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is expected to keep its interest rates unchanged on Tuesday. This is because the inflation rate for the third quarter was higher than predicted and above the central bank's 2.5% target.

This high inflation will likely be the deciding factor, outweighing the unexpected increase in the unemployment rate in September, especially since other job market indicators still show overall strength in employment.

Looking at China, the meeting between Presidents Xi and Trump last week successfully reduced the trade tensions between the two countries. Next week should be quieter in terms of major news from China.

The main economic report will be the trade data released on Friday. We predict that China's export growth will slow down to 4.0% compared to last year, and import growth will also drop slightly to 3.2%. This slower pace for both exports and imports is expected to cause China's trade surplus (how much more it exports than imports) to jump back up to $101 billion.

Lastly, we move to Japan where based on current projections, Japanese workers are expected to see their earnings and household spending increase. This suggests that consumer spending remains stable, even though inflation is high. Strong results from recent wage negotiations are likely to keep pushing wages higher, and the ongoing rally in the stock and asset markets could also encourage households to spend more.

US Government Shutdown Continues, BoE Decision and Inflation in Focus

Since the US government shutdown shows no sign of ending, we will have very little official economic data. However, the business and consumer surveys we do get are expected to confirm that the economy is slowing down. Key business reports (like the ISM indicators) suggest the economy is now growing at about 1-2%, which is decent but slower than the 2-3% growth seen recently.

Because the official jobs report is unavailable, the private ADP employment report has become extremely important. This report has shown that the private sector has cut jobs in three of the last four months, and we expect only a small gain of about 40,000 this month -- a number that doesn't signal a recovery, especially after major job cuts announced by companies like Amazon and UPS.

Finally, the University of Michigan confidence index will likely confirm that consumer confidence is weak due to worries about tariff-related price hikes and job security, meaning that spending by middle and lower-income families will likely continue to lag behind that of wealthier households.

Across the pond in the UK, stronger recent data on inflation and wages has brought back the possibility that the Bank of England might cut interest rates in November, although I still believe this is unlikely. The decision could be close, potentially a 5-4 vote in favor of keeping rates unchanged, with some members possibly voting for a much larger, 0.50% cut.

I don't expect the Bank to give any strong hint about a December cut, as they will want to review the government's late-November Autumn Budget first. However, my conviction regarding a December cut is growing, which would likely be followed by two more rate cuts in 2026.

This week's Chart of the week is the US Dollar Index (DXY)

From a technical perspective, the DXY has broken above a key resistance level around the 99.60 handle and is trading at a two-month high.

Deal between the US and China is undoing damage from a self-inflicted trade war

BUSAN, South Korea (AP) -- After months of posturing, arguing and threatening, U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have essentially turned back the clock. While the meeting between the two leaders was hailed by Trump as a "roaring success," the agreement that came out of it may only serve to undo some of the damages Trump inflicted with his trade war upon his return to the White House. Nevertheless, the deal has injected a degree of stability, giving the world's two largest economies -- as well as the rest of the world -- time and room to readjust.

Judges order Trump administration to use emergency reserves for SNAP payments during the shutdown

BOSTON (AP) -- Two federal judges ruled nearly simultaneously on Friday that President Donald Trump's administration must continue to pay for SNAP, the nation's biggest food aid program, using emergency reserve funds during the government shutdown.

The judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island gave the administration leeway on whether to fund the program partially or in full for November. That also brings uncertainty about how things will unfold and will delay payments for many beneficiaries whose cards would normally be recharged early in the month.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program starting Nov. 1 because it said it could no longer keep funding it due to the shutdown. The program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and is a major piece of the nation's social safety net. It costs about $8 billion per month nationally.

U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat and the ranking member of the Senate Agriculture committee that oversees the food aid program, said Friday's rulings from judges nominated to the bench by former President Barack Obama confirm what Democrats have been saying: "The administration is choosing not to feed Americans in need, despite knowing that it is legally required to do so."

Trump posted on social media Friday blasting congressional Democrats for the shutdown and suggesting the government would comply with the rulings but also that it needed more clarity first: "If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding."

Trump says Senate should scrap the filibuster to end the government shutdown

WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Donald Trump is calling on the Senate to scrap the filibuster, so that the Republican majority can bypass Democrats and reopen the federal government.

"THE CHOICE IS CLEAR -- INITIATE THE 'NUCLEAR OPTION,' GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER," Trump posted Thursday night on his social media site, Truth Social.

The filibuster is a long-standing tactic in the Senate to delay or block votes on legislation by keeping the debate running. It requires 60 votes in a full Senate to overcome a filibuster, giving Democrats a check on the 53-seat Republican majority that led to the start of the Oct. 1 shutdown when the new fiscal year began.

Trump's call to terminate the filibuster could alter the ways the Senate and congressional dealmaking operate, with the president saying in his post that he gave a "great deal" of thought to the choice on his flight back from Asia on Thursday.

Trump spent the past week with foreign leaders in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, finishing his tour by meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

Unidentified remains of 3 people transferred to Israel, Red Cross says

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- The Red Cross said it transferred the unidentified remains of three people to Israel late Friday but they were still being examined and may not be those of missing hostages, an Israeli military official said.

The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak to the media, said the remains had earlier been turned over to the Red Cross by Hamas in Gaza.

The handover follows Israel's return Friday of the bodies of 30 Palestinians to authorities in Gaza. That completed an exchange after militants turned over remains of two hostages, in a sign that the tense Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement is edging forward.

The incremental progress came despite Israeli strikes on Gaza this week that killed more than 100 people following the killing of an Israeli soldier.

The bodies were also transferred with the Red Cross serving as intermediary. The return of the Palestinian remains was confirmed by a doctor at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, where medical workers were striving to identify them.

Multiple people have been arrested in Michigan in a Halloween weekend attack plot, FBI director says

DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Multiple people who had been allegedly plotting a violent attack over the Halloween weekend were arrested Friday in Michigan, FBI Director Kash Patel said in a social media post.

The law enforcement effort was focused on suburban Detroit. Patel said more information would be released later.

Investigators believe the plot was inspired by Islamic State extremism and are investigating whether those in custody were potentially radicalized online, according to two people briefed on the investigation who could not publicly discuss details. They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

FBI and state police vehicles were in a neighborhood near Fordson High School in Dearborn. People wearing shirts marked FBI walked in and out of a house, including one person who collected paper bags and other items from an evidence truck.

Police in Inkster, another suburb, said FBI personnel were at a storage facility there.

Trump declines to clarify if the US will conduct tests of its nuclear weapons

ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) -- President Donald Trump declined to say Friday whether he plans to resume underground nuclear detonation tests, as he had seemed to suggest in a social media post this week that raised concerns the U.S. would begin testing nuclear weapons for the first time in three decades.

The president told reporters "You'll find out very soon," without elaborating when asked if he means to resume underground nuclear detonation tests.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth offered few details on Friday when asked about what nuclear testing the Pentagon would oversee. But he seemed to indicate to reporters that the intent was to test warheads when he said "resuming testing" would be "pretty responsible."

Trump, who spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One as he headed to Florida for a weekend stay, said, "We're going to do some testing" and "Other countries do it. If they're going to do it, we're going to" but then refused to offer more details.

His comments on nuclear testing have drawn confusion inside and outside the government when the president seemed to suggest in a brief post that the U.S. would resume nuclear warhead tests on an "equal basis" with Russia and China, whose last known tests were in the 1990s. Some of Trump's comments seemed to refer to testing missiles that would deliver a warhead, rather than the warhead itself. There has been no indication that the U.S. would start detonating warheads.

Royal prerogative: King Charles III banishes Andrew to buttress the House of Windsor's foundations

No one is bigger than the monarchy. Not even the king's brother.

In the end, that reality spelled the end of Andrew's life as a prince of the realm.

As details of Andrew's links to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein continued to dribble out and Parliament raised questions about his rent-free residence at a sprawling country house near Windsor Castle, King Charles III moved Thursday to shield the monarchy from any further revelations.

In a statement issued by Buckingham Palace, the king said he had taken steps to strip his brother of all his titles and honors, including the one he has held since birth -- prince. From now on, the scandal-plagued British royal will be known simply as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.

Andrew is also being forced to move out of Royal Lodge, the 30-room mansion near Windsor Castle where he has lived for more than 20 years.

Militia attack on hospital in Darfur came in waves, WHO says

CAIRO (AP) -- Groups of gunmen who reportedly killed at least 460 people at a hospital in Sudan attacked in several waves, abducting doctors and nurses, then gunning down staff, patients and people sheltering there, the World Health Organization said Friday.

The attack Tuesday in the country's Darfur region was part of a reported rampage by the Rapid Support Forces, a powerful paramilitary group, as it captured the key city of el-Fasher after besieging it for 18 months. Witnesses have reported fighters going house-to-house, killing civilians and committing sexual assaults.

Many details of the hospital attack and other violence in the city have been slow to emerge, and the total death toll remains unknown.

The fall of el-Fasher heralds a new phase of the brutal, two-year war between the RSF and the military in Africa's third-largest country.

The war has killed more than 40,000 people, according to U.N. figures, but aid groups say that is an undercount and the true number could be many times higher. The war has displaced more than 14 million people and fueled outbreaks of diseases believed to have killed thousands. Famine has been declared in parts of Darfur, a region the size of Spain, and other parts of the country.

Ohio panel and Virginia lawmakers move forward with congressional redistricting plans

An Ohio panel adopted new U.S. House districts on Friday that could boost the GOP's chances of winning two additional seats in next year's elections and aid President Donald Trump's efforts to hold on to a slim congressional majority.

The action by the Ohio Redistricting Commission came as Virginia's Democratic-led General Assembly advanced a proposed constitutional amendment that could pave the way for redistricting in the state ahead of the 2026 congressional elections. That measure needs another round of legislative approval early next year before it can go to voters.

Trump has been urging Republican-led states to reshape their U.S. House districts in an attempt to win more seats. But unlike in other states, Ohio's redistricting was required by the state constitution because the current districts were adopted after the 2020 census without bipartisan support.

Ohio joins Texas, Missouri and North Carolina, where Republican lawmakers already have revised congressional districts.

Democrats have been pushing back. California voters are deciding Tuesday on a redistricting plan passed by the Democratic-led Legislature.

Monkey escape in Mississippi gives a glimpse into the secretive world of animal research

The recent escape of several research monkeys after the truck carrying them overturned on a Mississippi interstate is the latest glimpse into the secretive industry of animal research and the processes that allow key details of what happened to be kept from the public.

Three monkeys have remained on the loose since the crash on Tuesday in a rural area along Interstate 59, spilling wooden crates labeled "live monkeys" into the tall grass near the highway. Since then, searchers in masks, face shields and other protective equipment have scoured nearby fields and woods for the missing primates. Five of the 21 Rhesus macaques on board were killed during the search, according to the local sheriff, but it was unclear how that happened.

Mississippi authorities have not disclosed the company involved in transporting the monkeys, where the monkeys were headed or who owns them. While Tulane University in New Orleans has acknowledged that the monkeys had been housed at its National Biomedical Research Center in Covington, Louisiana, it said it doesn't own them and won't identify who does.

An initial report from the sheriff described the monkeys as "aggressive" and carrying diseases such as herpes, adding to the confusion. Tulane later said the monkeys were free of pathogens, but it is still unclear what kind of research the monkeys were used for.

The questions surrounding the Mississippi crash and the mystery of why the animals were traveling through the South are remarkable, animal advocates say.

Amazon carries Wall Street to the finish of another winning week and month

NEW YORK (AP) -- Amazon led the U.S. stock market on Friday to the finish of another winning week and month.

The S&P 500 rose 0.3% and pulled closer to its all-time high set on Tuesday. It closed out a third straight winning week and a sixth straight winning month, its longest monthly winning streak since 2021.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 40 points, or 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.6%.

Amazon led the way and jumped 9.6%. The retail giant was by far the strongest force lifting the market after reporting profit for the latest quarter that blew past analysts' expectations. CEO Andy Jassy said growth for its booming cloud-computing business has accelerated to a pace it hasn't seen since 2022.

Amazon's massive size of roughly $2.4 trillion means its stock movements carry more weight on the S&P 500 than almost any other company's. Without it, the S&P 500 would have been down for the day.

CAIRO (AP) -- Groups of gunmen who reportedly killed at least 460 people at a hospital in Sudan attacked in several waves, abducting doctors and nurses, then gunning down staff, patients and people sheltering there, the World Health Organization said Friday.

The attack Tuesday in the country's Darfur region was part of a reported rampage by the Rapid Support Forces, a powerful paramilitary group, as it captured the key city of el-Fasher after besieging it for 18 months. Witnesses have reported fighters going house-to-house, killing civilians and committing sexual assaults.

Many details of the hospital attack and other violence in the city have been slow to emerge, and the total death toll remains unknown.

The fall of el-Fasher heralds a new phase of the brutal, two-year war between the RSF and the military in Africa's third-largest country.

The war has killed more than 40,000 people, according to U.N. figures, but aid groups say that is an undercount and the true number could be many times higher. The war has displaced more than 14 million people and fueled outbreaks of diseases believed to have killed thousands. Famine has been declared in parts of Darfur, a region the size of Spain, and other parts of the country.

Ohio panel and Virginia lawmakers move forward with congressional redistricting plans

An Ohio panel adopted new U.S. House districts on Friday that could boost the GOP's chances of winning two additional seats in next year's elections and aid President Donald Trump's efforts to hold on to a slim congressional majority.

The action by the Ohio Redistricting Commission came as Virginia's Democratic-led General Assembly advanced a proposed constitutional amendment that could pave the way for redistricting in the state ahead of the 2026 congressional elections. That measure needs another round of legislative approval early next year before it can go to voters.

Trump has been urging Republican-led states to reshape their U.S. House districts in an attempt to win more seats. But unlike in other states, Ohio's redistricting was required by the state constitution because the current districts were adopted after the 2020 census without bipartisan support.

Ohio joins Texas, Missouri and North Carolina, where Republican lawmakers already have revised congressional districts.

Democrats have been pushing back. California voters are deciding Tuesday on a redistricting plan passed by the Democratic-led Legislature.

Monkey escape in Mississippi gives a glimpse into the secretive world of animal research

The recent escape of several research monkeys after the truck carrying them overturned on a Mississippi interstate is the latest glimpse into the secretive industry of animal research and the processes that allow key details of what happened to be kept from the public.

Three monkeys have remained on the loose since the crash on Tuesday in a rural area along Interstate 59, spilling wooden crates labeled "live monkeys" into the tall grass near the highway. Since then, searchers in masks, face shields and other protective equipment have scoured nearby fields and woods for the missing primates. Five of the 21 Rhesus macaques on board were killed during the search, according to the local sheriff, but it was unclear how that happened.

Mississippi authorities have not disclosed the company involved in transporting the monkeys, where the monkeys were headed or who owns them. While Tulane University in New Orleans has acknowledged that the monkeys had been housed at its National Biomedical Research Center in Covington, Louisiana, it said it doesn't own them and won't identify who does.

An initial report from the sheriff described the monkeys as "aggressive" and carrying diseases such as herpes, adding to the confusion. Tulane later said the monkeys were free of pathogens, but it is still unclear what kind of research the monkeys were used for.

The questions surrounding the Mississippi crash and the mystery of why the animals were traveling through the South are remarkable, animal advocates say.

Amazon carries Wall Street to the finish of another winning week and month

NEW YORK (AP) -- Amazon led the U.S. stock market on Friday to the finish of another winning week and month.

The S&P 500 rose 0.3% and pulled closer to its all-time high set on Tuesday. It closed out a third straight winning week and a sixth straight winning month, its longest monthly winning streak since 2021.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 40 points, or 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.6%.

Amazon led the way and jumped 9.6%. The retail giant was by far the strongest force lifting the market after reporting profit for the latest quarter that blew past analysts' expectations. CEO Andy Jassy said growth for its booming cloud-computing business has accelerated to a pace it hasn't seen since 2022.

Amazon's massive size of roughly $2.4 trillion means its stock movements carry more weight on the S&P 500 than almost any other company's. Without it, the S&P 500 would have been down for the day.

## 29. Trump Admin to reduce tariffs on China as Bakersfield businesses hope for economic relief

**Full Text:**

BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (KERO) -- With trade talks between the U.S. and China recently resuming, local business owners are cautiously optimistic that new agreements may finally ease years of mounting costs.

In a pivotal meeting on October 30, 2025, between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea, the two leaders agreed to roll back certain tariffs on Chinese imports.

Under the deal, tariffs are expected to drop from approximately 57 % to 47 % for many goods, including a reduction of a "fentanyl-precursor" tariff from

20 % to 10 %.

For smaller retailers in Bakersfield -- such as KJJC Collectables, which specializes in Funko Pops, retro finds and unique treasures -- the relief cannot come soon enough.

Owner Jim Gillis says years of tariffs on goods imported from China have taken a toll.

"Business is tough. We're basically just trying to make it through these last three and a half years -- it's been rough on everybody. I'm just a small business."

Gillis reports that popular items such as Funko Pops have seen price increases of roughly 25-30â€‰% due to import cost hikes: an item that once sold for about $13 now goes for around $16.

While the tariff reduction signals hope for easing supply-chain pressures, local business owners emphasize the challenge ahead with fewer consumers spending on non-essentials, the pressure on small retailers remains intense.

"Still, any drop helps. Nobody wants higher costs."

Gillis adds, "It just is what it is. You can't force people to buy. None of the things I sell are necessities -- they're just things people enjoy collecting."

Economists caution the deal may be a short-term truce rather than a full resolution of trade tensions.

Though China committed to easing export restrictions on rare earth elements and ramping up purchases of U.S. soybeans part of the agreement reached core structural issues between the two economies remain unresolved.

For Bakersfield businesses like KJJC Collectables, the hope is that sustained negotiation will lead to meaningful cost relief and improved consumer confidence.

But with the economic outlook still uncertain, many are preparing for a cautious future.

China's President Xi Jinping will meet his new South Korean counterpart Lee Jae Myung as both leaders work to rebuild ties between their two countries, after years of Seoul moving closer to the US.

The meeting will take place Saturday afternoon on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea, according to Lee's office. It follows separate talks both leaders held with US President Donald Trump, during which Washington and Seoul finalized a trade and investment deal that will see Korean companies channel billions of dollars into the US each year.

## 31. Federal judge blocks Trump order requiring citizenship proof on federal voter registration forms

**Full Text:**

U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick recounts the meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.'

A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot enforce an executive order requiring documented proof of U.S. citizenship on federal voter registration forms -- a decision the administration defends as a lawful effort to protect election integrity.

U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington, D.C., on Friday found the requirement unconstitutional, writing that the president "lacks the authority to direct such changes."

"The first question presented in these consolidated cases is whether the president, acting unilaterally, may direct changes to federal election procedures," Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly wrote in her opinion. "Because our Constitution assigns responsibility for election regulation to the States and to Congress, this Court holds that the President lacks the authority to direct such changes."

CALIFORNIA REPUBLICANS LAUNCH VOTER ID BALLOT PUSH, NEED 875K SIGNATURES BY DEADLINE

However, a spokesperson for the White House told Fox News Digital that Trump acted within his legal powers.

"President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to ensure only American citizens are casting ballots in American elections," White House Deputy Press Secretary Abigail Jackson told Fox News Digital in an email. "This is so commonsense that only the Democrat Party would file a lawsuit against it."

She added, "We expect to be vindicated by a higher court."

The judge sided with the plaintiffs -- including the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), the Democratic National Committee and the League of Women Voters Education Fund -- arguing that the Constitution "assigns no direct role to the president in either domain."

NEARLY ALL REPUBLICAN AGS ADD FIREPOWER TO TRUMP'S BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP PUSH

The ruling says the U.S. Election Assistance Commission is permanently blocked from adding the requirement to the federal voter form, according to the Associated Press.

The lawsuit will continue as the judge examines other parts of Trump's order, according to the Associated Press.

In March, President Trump signed an executive order mandating that anyone registering to vote provide government-issued proof of U.S. citizenship.

The order also directed the attorney general to enter into information-sharing agreements with state election officials to identify cases of election fraud or other election law violations and conditioned federal election-related funds on states complying with federal election integrity measures.

TRUMP ADMIN BLOCKS CITIZENSHIP FOR NON-CITIZEN VOTERS

"There are other steps that we will be taking in the coming weeks," Trump said just before signing the order. "We think we'll be able to end up getting fair elections."

Kollar-Kotelly had previously issued a preliminary injunction in April, and another federal judge blocked the same March 25 executive order in June following a separate challenge brought by Democratic state attorneys general, the Associated Press reported.

## 32. APEC summit to close in South Korea after Trump, Xi agreed on trade truce

**Full Text:**

GYEONGJU, South Korea (AP) -- Leaders of 21 Asian and Pacific Rim nations are to set to wrap up their annual economic forum on Saturday after President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed on a temporary truce on their trade war, generating relief around the world.

This year's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in the South Korean city of Gyeongju was heavily overshadowed by Thursday's Trump-Xi meeting that ended with the two leaders dialing back their earlier trade steps and de-escalating their trade tensions.

The high-stakes meeting was arranged on the sidelines of APEC. Trump, known for his dismissal of multilateralism, quickly left South Korea after reaching deals with Xi, allowing the Chinese president to steal the limelight at the summit.

During the APEC summit's opening session Friday, Xi said China would support global free trade and supply chain stability in an apparent effort to position his country as an alternative to Trump's protectionist policies. In written remarks sent to a CEO summit held in conjunction with APEC, Xi said that "Investing in China is investing in the future."

Xi met his Japanese, Canadian and Thai counterparts bilaterally on the sidelines of APEC on Friday. He's to meet South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Saturday for talks that Seoul officials said would touch on efforts to achieve denuclearization and peace on the Korean Peninsula.

That agenda at the Xi-Lee meeting angered North Korea, a non-APEC member. North Korea's Vice Foreign Minister Pak Myong Ho on Saturday slammed South Korea for talking about "its daydream" of realizing North Korea's denuclearization, saying North Korea will show how such a push is "a pipedream" that can never be realized. Park's statement was seen as applying pressure on both South Korea and China ahead of their bilateral summit.

Trump earlier repeatedly expressed his desire to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong U n during his visit to South Korea, but North Korea hasn't responded. Trump and Kim met three times in 2018-19, but their nuclear diplomacy eventually collapsed. North Korea has since vowed not to place its advancing nuclear program on a negotiating table, but experts say the North would aim for winning extensive sanctions relief in return for a partial surrender of its advancing nuclear program.

Friday's APEC meeting focused on ways to boost trade and investment, and Saturday's meeting is expected to center on artificial intelligence, demographic challenges and new growth strategies.

As the host nation, South Korea has been prodding members to adopt a joint declaration at the end of APEC's second and final day session on Saturday. In a 2018 APEC summit in Papua New Guinea, members failed to come up with a joint declaration due to U.S.-China discord over trade.

South Korean officials earlier said that issuing a joint statement strongly endorsing free trade would be unlikely because of differing positions among APEC members

Established in 1989, APEC champions free and open trade and investment to accelerate regional economic integration. But the APEC region now faces challenges like strategic rivalry between the U.S. and China, supply chain disruptions, aging populations and the impact of AI on jobs.

The U.S. strategy has been shifted to economic competitions with China rather than cooperation, with Trump's tariff hikes and "America first" agenda shaking markets and threatening decades of globalization and multinationalism.

## 33. Trump plays coy as world leaders condemn call for US nuclear testing after 32-year moratorium

ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE, Nov 1 -- President Donald Trump reiterated Friday that he wants testing of US nuclear weapons, but again failed to clarify whether he meant live explosions in an order that has provoked global tension and confusion.

Asked by an AFP journalist whether he meant conducting underground blasts for the first time in the United States since 1992, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One: "I am not going to say."

"You'll find out very soon, but we're going to do some testing, yeah. Other countries do it. If they're going to do it, we're going do it," he said on his way to spend Halloween at his golf resort in Florida.

No country other than North Korea has conducted an explosive nuclear weapon test for decades. Russia and China have not carried out such tests since 1990 and 1996 respectively.

The 79-year-old Republican first made his surprise testing announcement by social media post on Thursday, minutes before entering a summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea.

The announcement came in the wake of Russia saying it had tested a new nuclear-powered cruise missile, the Burevestnik, and a nuclear-powered and nuclear-capable underwater drone.

Iran, whose own controversial nuclear program was bombed by US forces on Trump's orders earlier this year, called Trump's directive "regressive and irresponsible."

"A nuclear-armed bully is resuming testing of atomic weapons. The same bully has been demonising Iran's peaceful nuclear programme," Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi posted on social media.

'Pretty responsible'

Japanese atomic bomb survivors group Nihon Hidankyo sent a letter of protest to the US embassy in Japan.

The order "directly contradicts the efforts by nations around the world striving for a peaceful world without nuclear weapons and is utterly unacceptable," the Nobel Peace Prize-winning group said in the letter obtained by AFP.

Amid concern abroad and some in the US Congress, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon was moving "quickly" to follow Trump's orders and said testing was "responsible."

"The president was clear. We need to have a credible nuclear deterrent," he told reporters in Kuala Lumpur.

"Resuming testing is a pretty responsible, very responsible way to do that. I think it makes nuclear conflict less likely."

But China's foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun urged the United States to "earnestly abide" by a global nuclear testing ban.

United Nations chief Antonio Guterres said through a spokesman that "nuclear testing can never be permitted under any circumstances."

The United States has been a signatory since 1996 to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which bans all atomic test explosions, whether for military or civilian purposes.

Russia pushes back

Russia pushed back against any idea that its recent weapon systems tests could justify a return to live test explosions.

The Kremlin questioned whether Trump was well-informed - and implied Russia would conduct its own live detonations if Trump does so first.

The recent weapons drills "cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test," spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. "We hope that the information was conveyed correctly to President Trump."

According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the Russian stockpile of deployed and stored warheads is 4,309, compared to 3,700 for the United States and 600 for China - figures that don't take into account hundreds of other warheads scheduled for dismantling.

The United States conducted 1,054 nuclear tests between July 16, 1945, when the first was conducted in New Mexico, and 1992.

Its two nuclear attacks on Japan during World War II make it the only country to have used the weapons in combat.

The last US nuclear test explosion was in September 1992, a 20-kiloton underground detonation at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site.

Then-president George H.W. Bush imposed a moratorium on further tests in October 1992 that has been continued by successive administrations. -- AFP

## 34. Analysis: China's Xi has the advantage after his trade meeting with Trump

**Full Text:**

As the dust begins to settle around a less-than-two-hour meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump on Thursday at an air base in South Korea, it's clear that Chinese leaders have racked up another victory in their tough strategy with the United States.

The meeting did not result in an overall trade deal, but rather a return to an uneasy truce based on a handful of agreements intended to keep the relationship stable as the two sides move toward one.

Xi secured a 10% reduction in Trump's recently imposed 30% tariffs on Chinese goods this year in exchange for stepping up efforts to control his role in the U.S. fentanyl crisis. He also won U.S. agreement to suspend a new rule that would have dramatically increased the number of Chinese companies blacklisted to prevent them from buying sensitive U.S. technology.

Trump avoided Beijing imposing an expanded set of restrictions that could have crippled global industries dependent on Chinese rare earth minerals. China will also increase purchases of U.S. soybeans and other agricultural products, U.S. officials said. The two sides also suspended port taxes targeting each other's shipping sectors and will extend a truce on higher tariffs.

On paper, this seems like a reasonable exchange and one that delivers, at least for the moment, what both leaders (and the global economy as a whole) wanted: stability after a tumultuous year of fighting between the heavyweights of the global economy.

But for Beijing, the agreements accompanied by Trump's enthusiastic praise of Xi are also a clear confirmation of the success of its strategy in handling Trump 2.0.

That's because Beijing managed to secure valuable concessions on tariffs and export controls, while mostly conceding to measures it only put in place in retaliation against those of the United States.

Take soybeans, a key U.S. export that has seen Chinese purchases fall this year due to trade frictions.

China has agreed to buy at least 25 million tonnes of US soybeans per year over the next three years, US Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said after the negotiations.

But that baseline figure remains 1.8 million tonnes lower than China's soybean purchases last year, before the tensions, according to US data.

China's highly nationalistic and censored Internet recorded all of this on Friday, when social media commentators praised how China had really pulled off this tariff war and observed that Trump had finally sorted out the mess Trump created.

The outlook is not all rosy for China.

Even though tariffs from this year's U.S. trade conflict have been reduced to 20%, Chinese exporters still face tariffs that average nearly 50% on their goods, taking into account pre-existing duties. This rate remains among the highest imposed on any country by the United States. Washington has meanwhile seen real progress in its objective of reducing its trade deficit.

And, although the deal has yet to be signed, Beijing may have made some real concessions over the fate of social media app TikTok, having changed its mind by strongly opposing a US law forcing the app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell its US operations.

China also remains blocked from accessing high-end U.S. chips, a key weapon in the high-stakes AI race between the two countries.

But on the technology front, Beijing's ability to push back for at least a year the new U.S. rule that would have dramatically increased the number of Chinese companies banned from buying sensitive U.S. technology, is a major boon for Chinese companies.

The now-suspended U.S. effort to close the loopholes could have trapped some 20,000 more companies than are already on the list, according to an analysis by business intelligence firm WireScreen.

It's another victory for Beijing's strategy of using its near-total hold over the global rare earth supply chain as leverage against the United States, a tactic it also deployed during a tariff escalation earlier this year.

And on the Chinese side, it is unlikely that Beijing will agree to postpone for at least a year its expanded export control regime for rare earth minerals, announced in retaliation for the expansion of the US blacklist, as a major setback.

As one China specialist, foreign policy analyst Shen Dingli, told CNN earlier this month, these measures constituted a nuclear option that Beijing knew was not symmetrical, but if China does not use the weapon, it has little left to negotiate.

The next big question is whether Xi and Trump can maintain dÃ©tente as they work toward a broader deal and planned visits to their respective countries in 2026.

After all, Canada knows full well that a trade truce with Trump can quickly fail.

A series of pitfalls, both predictable and unexpected, in the expansive rivalry between the United States and China could derail the newly achieved stability, and whatever deal is ultimately reached is unlikely to resolve the deep-rooted structural problems between the two.

But as Trump took off from South Korea's Gimhae International Airport on Thursday to return to the United States stuck in the quagmire of a frozen government, Xi stayed to attend an international summit and tout China as a beacon of globalization, it is clear that the balance of power between them has shifted.

## 36. APEC summit to close in South Korea after Trump, Xi agreed on trade truce

**Full Text:**

GYEONGJU, South Korea (AP) -- Leaders of 21 Asian and Pacific Rim nations are to set to wrap up their annual economic forum on Saturday after President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed on a temporary truce on their trade war, generating relief around the world.

This year's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in the South Korean city of Gyeongju was heavily overshadowed by Thursday's Trump-Xi meeting that ended with the two leaders dialing back their earlier trade steps and de-escalating their trade tensions.

The high-stakes meeting was arranged on the sidelines of APEC. Trump, known for his dismissal of multilateralism, quickly left South Korea after reaching deals with Xi, allowing the Chinese president to steal the limelight at the summit.

During the APEC summit's opening session Friday, Xi said China would support global free trade and supply chain stability in an apparent effort to position his country as an alternative to Trump's protectionist policies. In written remarks sent to a CEO summit held in conjunction with APEC, Xi said that "Investing in China is investing in the future."

Xi met his Japanese, Canadian and Thai counterparts bilaterally on the sidelines of APEC on Friday. He's to meet South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Saturday for talks that Seoul officials said would touch on efforts to achieve denuclearization and peace on the Korean Peninsula.

That agenda at the Xi-Lee meeting angered North Korea, a non-APEC member. North Korea's Vice Foreign Minister Pak Myong Ho on Saturday slammed South Korea for talking about "its daydream" of realizing North Korea's denuclearization, saying North Korea will show how such a push is "a pipedream" that can never be realized. Park's statement was seen as applying pressure on both South Korea and China ahead of their bilateral summit.

Trump earlier repeatedly expressed his desire to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong U n during his visit to South Korea, but North Korea hasn't responded. Trump and Kim met three times in 2018-19, but their nuclear diplomacy eventually collapsed. North Korea has since vowed not to place its advancing nuclear program on a negotiating table, but experts say the North would aim for winning extensive sanctions relief in return for a partial surrender of its advancing nuclear program.

Friday's APEC meeting focused on ways to boost trade and investment, and Saturday's meeting is expected to center on artificial intelligence, demographic challenges and new growth strategies.

As the host nation, South Korea has been prodding members to adopt a joint declaration at the end of APEC's second and final day session on Saturday. In a 2018 APEC summit in Papua New Guinea, members failed to come up with a joint declaration due to U.S.-China discord over trade.

South Korean officials earlier said that issuing a joint statement strongly endorsing free trade would be unlikely because of differing positions among APEC members

Established in 1989, APEC champions free and open trade and investment to accelerate regional economic integration. But the APEC region now faces challenges like strategic rivalry between the U.S. and China, supply chain disruptions, aging populations and the impact of AI on jobs.

The U.S. strategy has been shifted to economic competitions with China rather than cooperation, with Trump's tariff hikes and "America first" agenda shaking markets and threatening decades of globalization and multinationalism.

## 37. Trump and Takaichi bond over a mutual friend - and a mutual enemy | CNN

**Full Text:**

During their closely watched first meeting in Tokyo, Donald Trump and Sanae Takaichi looked more like old friends than world leaders.

There were smiles, back slaps, hugs and even a joke about running late because they'd been watching the LA Dodgers - led by Japanese megastar Shohei Ohtani - play in the World Series.

The US president received a Nobel Peace Prize nomination (the second of his Asia trip), and a golf putter previously owned by the late former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who famously bonded with Trump on the green.

Their easy camaraderie continued at the Yokosuka naval base, where Trump invited Takaichi on stage aboard the USS George Washington and praised her leadership. The new Japanese PM responded with a triumphant fist pump and a twirl, a moment that quickly went viral in her country.

The message was unmistakable: the Abe-era chemistry between Washington and Tokyo is back.

"She is a delight," Trump told business leaders at the conclusion of the day's activities. "I got to know her pretty well in a short period of time."

It's not often Trump shows this level of warmth toward a foreign leader, particularly one from a country that's weathered his tariff wars. It's just as rare to see a Japanese prime minister display such open affection on the world stage.

It certainly helps that the two see eye to eye on several political issues. Both are right-wing conservatives who support military buildup and a tougher stance on China. Their shared connection to Abe also helps explain their rapport. Abe was one of Trump's "best friends" in global politics, as well as being Takaichi's political mentor.

But beneath the photo ops and nostalgia also lies a strategic alliance born of mutual need. Especially as both leaders eye the same adversary in Beijing.

For Trump, having a staunch ally in the Asia-Pacific region willing to take a hard line against China is an undeniable win. Takaichi, a longtime China hawk, has criticized Beijing's military expansion and economic coercion for years. Her hardline stance dovetails neatly with Trump's "America First" worldview.

The two also unveiled a new framework on rare earths, aimed at reducing dependence on China's near-monopoly over critical resources. Details were vague, but the message of cooperation was clear. Japan still remembers the 2010 "rare earths shock," when Beijing cut off exports after a territorial dispute. Takaichi has since made securing stable supply chains a key part of her economic agenda.

Trade and investment also featured prominently at the summit. Japan pledged roughly $490 billion in US-bound investments, led by companies in AI, semiconductors, defense and advanced manufacturing, part of a broader trade deal already agreed upon by the allies in September.

For Trump, who prizes loyalty and has a long memory for slights, an allegiance to Japan solidified early in his first term. Abe took great care to develop the US-Japan relationship, at a time when the president did not have a lot of support on the world stage.

Foreign dignitaries and leaders openly laughed at the president during a 2018 United Nations General Assembly address. In 2019, a group of NATO leaders were captured on camera gossiping about him.

But Abe cultivated his American counterpart with thoughtful gestures that played directly to Trump's interests: multiple golf outings, the pomp and circumstance of a state banquet, and a trip to a sumo wrestling tournament where Trump bestowed the winner with a "President's Cup."

Trump remained close to his counterpart until Abe's assassination in 2022, and hosted his widow at Mar-a-Lago last year.

That goodwill paved the way for Takaichi's success on Wednesday.

"He really likes her," said a senior Trump administration official who observed their interactions behind closed doors.

She also benefited from timing: Takaichi took office after Trump's reciprocal tariffs rocked markets and reimagined US alliances - shielding her from tangling with the Trump administration to negotiate a trade deal.

For Takaichi, standing shoulder to shoulder with Trump strengthens her hand at home. Her approval ratings soared after taking office, but her ruling party still lacks a parliamentary majority after recent election losses. Public frustration over past scandals also lingers. Projecting Japan's influence abroad, and reaffirming its bond with Washington, helps her rebuild political capital.

For Trump, the optics are just as valuable. Hardening a close alliance with Tokyo gives him diplomatic momentum ahead of a more contentious meeting with China's Xi Jinping. It's also a reminder to Beijing that he's not short on powerful friends in the region.

## 38. Quiet unifier Pope Leo looks likely to lead buttoned-up papacy

**Full Text:**

During that time, his every move -- and especially his every public utterance -- is scrutinised for clues as to what type of papacy he embodies.

We are now halfway through this period since the election of Robert Prevost as Pope Leo XIV on May 8, but clues as to what kind of pontiff he will be are not very plentiful or insightful.

He is the first American to occupy the role, but he has yet to show his true colours.

"In the hours and days after his election, there was a mad rush by journalists and ordinary Catholics alike to parse through every statement he had ever made and every interview he had ever given to better understand where he might fall on some of the Church's most contentious debates," according to Christopher White, the author of Pope Leo XIV and the Dawn of a New Papacy, the first English-language biography of Prevost.

"But unlike some cardinals who jet around the world keynoting conferences and writing books, there is a limited paper trail for the new Pope."

Unlike his fellow countryman, who bestrides the world stage like a blonde colossus, the "new" Pope continues to hide his light under a bushel.

He has displayed none of the bombast or attention-seeking of Donald Trump, nor has he made headline-grabbing statements.

He is certainly not a "rock star" Pope in the manner of John Paul II.

But precisely because of Trump, and his unbridled ambition and disregard for convention and moral norms, the election of Prevost has caused some unease among political scientists and diplomats due to how it has been perceived in places such as Moscow, Beijing, New Delhi, Tokyo, Riyadh, and Islamabad, as well as Berlin and Paris -- places where, like it or not, the presence of an American Pope in the Vatican will be seen as enhancing the global reach and influence of the US.

That's just part of the geo-political realities at a time when a new world order appears to be taking shape. Leo XIV, as an American, is not going to be regarded as a neutral player by the policymakers around the likes of Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping driving that new world order.

Among Vatican insiders, the conventional wisdom had long been that it would be unwise to have a US pope -- the opposition to such a development was based on the optics of having a pontiff from a political superpower, and what that might mean in terms of augmenting that superpower's hegemonic influence.

The underlying assumption was that a president and pope should never come from the same place.

However, other concerns meant these fears were set aside at the conclave in May -- chiefly that it would seem because of the need to find remedies for the Vatican's dire financial situation -- and it opened the way for Robert Prevost to become the 267th occupant of the role.

But if the Pope Leo goes after Maga money to sort out the Vatican's financial crisis, some observers fear this could draw him into an alliance of some sorts with Trump

There is no doubt that the Vatican's money problems is one of the items marked "urgent" in the Pope's in-tray.

"Just days before Francis entered hospital for his final time, in February 2025, he established a new global fundraising commission to help close the Vatican's annual budget shortfalls," said White.

"While hard figures have always been difficult to come by for an institution that has never had clear accounting procedures, a July 2024 report estimated an annual operating budget deficit of â‚¬87m.

"Compounding the problem is a looming pension fund crisis that is estimated to be underfunded by â‚¬1.5bn."

In addition to finances, Pope Leo faces a number of other ongoing challenges -- including the ongoing scandal of clergy abuse and the Vatican's desultory response to this.

Just last week, Reuters reported that, in Italy, 4,400 people were abused by Catholic priests in cases reported since 2020.

"In an usually critical report on the issue published on October 16, the Vatican's child protection commission said only 81 of Italy's 226 dioceses responded to a questionnaire about safeguarding practices it had drafted," the report said.

Reuters said that Pope Leo, who met survivors of sexual abuse by clergy for the first time just recently, had told the Church's newest bishops not to hide misconduct allegations.

"The global Catholic Church has been shaken for decades by scandals involving paedophile priests and the cover-up of their crimes, but local church leaders in Italy have been less forthcoming in confronting the issue."

The Pope himself is exposed on this issue. According to Christopher White, who was the Vatican correspondent of the National Catholic Reporter, he is dogged by accusations that, as a former provincial of the Augustinians and as bishop of Chiclayo in Peru, he mishandled several cases of abuse.

"A more high-profile case involves three women from the diocese who have alleged that Prevost failed to open an investigation into allegations that they had been abused by two priests."

Former president Mary McAleese, who holds a doctorate in Canon Law from the Gregorian University in Rome, has already been harshly critical of Pope Leo, based on the first 100 days of his pontificate.

Writing in the Catholic weekly The Tablet, she described him as "bog-standard patriarchal, patronising, and prone to tokenism", noting that he had inherited a theology of male-only priesthood and has shown no inclination to challenge it.

On the evidence so far, this looks like being a very buttoned-up papacy with little likelihood of doctrinal reform and a rigid cleaving to tradition. This latter means no prospect of significant change on such "hot" button issues as sexuality, the ordination of women, or the admission of married priests -- despite the crisis in vocations, so painfully evident in Ireland at present.

Robert Prevost was born in Chicago on September 14, 1955, and was ordained in 1982. He spent over 10 years in Peru, even taking out Peruvian citizenship, becoming the bishop of Chiclayo in 2014.

Back in Chicago for a spell, he was elected head of the Augustinians in 2001 before returning to Peru.

Pope Francis brought him to Rome in 2023, making him head of the Dicastery for Bishops and a cardinal a few months later. This gave him the enhanced profile that would count in the conclave that followed the death of Francis last April.

While in Peru, Prevost's pastoral work among the poor and displaced earned him a reputation as a quiet unifier.

This was at a time when Shining Path, a Peruvian guerrilla movement, was waging a violent anti-government campaign. In the ensuing "dirty war", an estimated 25,000 people died.

At this time, liberation theology -- which had its origins in Latin America -- had gained a wide audience. It was committed to changing unjust structures, along with the promotion of socio-economic change in a continent with great divides between rich and poor.

It was opposed not just by wealthy and powerful figures and military dictators but also by influential Cardinals in the Vatican, who regarded it as "too political" and tainted by Marxism.

It is not known if Peru's Fr Gustavo GutiÃ©rrez, considered the father of liberation theology, ever had Prevost's full support.

Ecumenical prayer

As Pope Leo XIV, he made history last month when he and Britain's King Charles III (who is head of the Church of England) participated in public in an ecumenical prayer in the Sistine Chapel, a first time for the leaders of the two faiths (Catholicism and Anglicanism) since the Reformation.

The Pope will make his first trip abroad on November 27, when he travels to the Turkish city of Iznik, formerly Nicaea, where the first ecumenical council of Christianity was held 1,700 years ago and which produced the Nicene Creed, a central profession of faith.

The Council of Nicaea (325-2025) was the first ecumenical council in history -- the first in a series of 21 great councils up to and including Vatican II (1962-65).

The visit, which has important ecumenical dimensions, was one planned before the death of Pope Francis.

The gathering, in what was the ancient city of Nicaea, will also include the Orthodox Patriarch of Constantinople, Bartholomew.

The theme of unity is close to the heart of Pope Leo, and is reflected in his motto ("In the One, we are one").

The meeting between the Pope and the Orthodox patriarch will be seen as a step towards reconciliation between the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches, which have been divided since the Great Schism of 1054.

**Full Text:**

New Delhi [India], November 1 (ANI): Navy Vice Chief Vice Admiral Sanjay Vatsayan said that all three defence forces are monitoring developments in the region amid the growing relationship between Bangladesh and Pakistan.

'I want to assure you that all three defence forces and agencies are monitoring the situation and developments, and we are taking all necessary steps,' Vice Admiral Vatsayan said.

The remarks of the Navy Vice Chief hold significance as the regime change in Bangladesh following Sheikh Hasina's exit saw an interim government led by Muhammad Yunus foster closer relations between Dhaka and Islamabad.

Last week, the Chairman of Pakistan's Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, paid a courtesy call on Bangladesh's Chief Adviser, Professor Muhammad Yunus, at the State Guest House Jamuna late on Saturday.

'During the meeting, they discussed a wide range of issues concerning Bangladesh-Pakistan relations, including the growing importance of bilateral trade, investment, and defence cooperation,' the Chief Adviser's Press Wing said in a statement on Sunday.

Bangladesh's National Security Adviser Dr Khalilur Rahman, Senior Secretary and SDG Coordinator Lamiya Morshed, and Pakistan's High Commissioner to Bangladesh Imran Haider were present during the meeting.

Navy Vice Chief Vice Admiral Sanjay Vatsayan said that both the US and Russia will participate in the international fleet review and Milan exercise.

'Both US and Russia have confirmed participation in the international fleet review and Milan exercise. They would be sending their ships. Some aircraft are also expected,' he said.

Recently, Trump directed the Pentagon to match Russia and China in nuclear weapons testing. The Trump administration announced its decision after Russia carried out nuclear-powered weapons tests shortly before the US president was set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea.

He said that almost 55 countries have expressed their willingness to attend the events.

'We have extended invites to a large number of nations, and so far, we have received responses from over 55 countries that have expressed their willingness to attend all three events. A huge number of navies are also participating through high-level delegations in addition to sending their ships. However, as you are aware, we still have four months to go. So these numbers will change as more confirmations come in,' he said.

'And as geopolitics evolves, we cannot predict what will happen in 7 or 15 days. So there will be a change in the numbers. However, we are definitely expecting more than 55. And yes, both the United States and Russia are participating. They have indicated that they will be sending their ships, and we are also expecting some aircraft, maybe, but it's still work in progress,' he added.

Vatsayan said that at any given point in time, about 50 ships are present in the Indian Ocean.

'There is a continuous presence of extra-regional powers in the Indian Ocean region due to the ongoing situation. It has always been that and it's only increasing. At any given point of time, we have a minimum of 40, but going even beyond 50 odd ships that are operating in the Indian Ocean region and just to assure all of you, we are monitoring each and every one of them. We are aware of what they're doing, what they're likely to do, when do they come in, when they go out, etc. Challenges remain. You've seen what has happened in Madagascar,' he said.

He further stated that the Indian Ocean is the primary source of goods and oil transit.

'But the bottom line remains that the Indian Ocean is the main source of transit of goods and oil as far as the world is concerned. That does not change. And with it, it brings its associated challenges with respect to traditional as well as non-traditional issues. It is across the spectrum that we look at, from piracy to human trafficking to drugs and so on and so forth. So these challenges are there, and we are alive to them. We are ready to meet any contingency,' he said.

Vatsayan further said that the navy was expecting to induct four ships to be delivered by the end of December.

'This year, we have inducted 10 ships and one submarine, and I am expecting another four ships to be delivered before the end of December. And I think next year we've got 19 vessels which are likely to be inducted, and most of them should be commissioned by December. And next to next year, about 13 ships that we are expecting to be delivered to the Indian Navy,' he said.

Director General of Naval Operations, Vice Admiral AN Pramod, said that their main objective is to enhance synergy between all maritime forces.

'We are conducting a tri-service exercise on the Gujarat coast and in the northern Arabian Sea. All three services-Army, Navy, Air Force-as well as the Coast Guard, BSF, and central agencies, are participating in large numbers. You'll find the Army's Southern Command, the Navy's Western Command, and the Air Force's South Western Air Command participating. Our main objective is to enhance synergy between all maritime forces. It is a very large complex environment, and this is a multi-domain integrated operation which we are conducting... 20-25 Navy ships are participating. Over 40 Air Force fighter and support aircraft are participating,' he said.

The Indian Navy will organise the International Fleet Review (IFR) in February 2026 in Visakhapatnam, where President Droupadi Murmu will review the fleet on February 18, the officials announced on Friday. (ANI)

## 40. In Tokyo, Trump and Takaichi bonded over a mutual friend - and a mutual enemy

## 41. How rare earths became the next trade war weapon

**Full Text:**

The US remains heavily dependent on China for rare earths, which are essential to defence, clean energy, and high-tech manufacturing. While the delay eases immediate pressure on industries reliant on rare earths, it should prompt a renewed focus on building alternative supply routes - from developing domestic mining, processing and refining capacity to strengthening partnerships with allied producers.

The trade-truce buys time, but lasting security will depend on reducing exposure to China's dominance in this critical sector.

Why are rare earths critical?

Rare earth elements (REEs) - a group of 17 chemically related elements including neodymium, dysprosium, and terbium - are essential to the functioning of modern economies. Rare earths are key to everything from smartphones and wind turbines to EV motors and advanced military systems.

The 17 rare earth elements are typically grouped into light REEs (LREEs), including lanthanum, cerium, neodymium, praseodymium, which are used in magnets, batteries and catalysts, and heavy REEs (HREEs), which include dysprosium, terbium, yttrium - they are rarer, used in high-performance magnets, lasers, and alloys.

Rare earths are not actually rare, geologically speaking. For example, cerium is more abundant than copper. But although REEs are abundant in the Earth's crust, they are rarely found in concentrations suitable for economic extraction. Their chemical similarity makes separation complex and environmentally challenging.

China's dominance is decades in the making

The US was the world's top producer of rare earths until the 1980s, before China's dominance rose due to lower costs and government support for its rare earths industry.

China's dominance didn't happen overnight. Beginning in the 1980s, Beijing identified rare earths as a strategic industry, supporting development through subsidies, financing, favourable regulation and export controls.

By the 1990s, China had become the world's leading producer. Deng Xiaoping famously said in 1992: "The Middle East has its oil; China has rare earths".

Today, China accounts for roughly 70% of global REE mine output, 90% of refining, and over 90% of magnet production.

Supply chain bottleneck

The rare earth supply chain is highly concentrated. Deposits exist outside of China, notably in Brazil, the US, and Australia, but many rely on Chinese refiners. It is refining capacity, rather than mineral wealth, that is the source of vulnerability.

Australia's Lynas Rare Earths is the world's largest supplier of rare earths outside of China; it relies on Malaysia for part of its refining.

Only two refineries exist outside China: one in the US and one in Malaysia.

Scaling up remains slow due to high costs, technical complexity, and long permitting deadlines. Building a new mine can take eight to ten years, while building a new refinery takes about five.

Building mines, refineries, and processing plants in places like Australia, the US, and Europe also costs more because of higher capital needs, stricter environmental rules, and pricier labour and energy than in China.

Even if the planned refineries outside China come online by 2030, total capacity will just be half of China's 2024 supply (according to BNEF data).

But without independent refining capacity, Western producers remain dependent on China.

How has Beijing used rare earths as a weapon in the trade war?

China has a history of using its dominance in the supply of rare earths as a pressure tool.

China's grip on the rare earths market became apparent in 2010 when it blocked exports to Japan for two months over a territorial dispute. The US, the European Union and Japan eventually forced Beijing to overturn the measures via the World Trade Organisation. The incident spurred Japan's efforts to reduce its reliance on China. Japan's dependence on China's rare earths dropped from around 90% at the time of the incident to around 60% today.

This year saw a significant escalation of China's rare earth restrictions as Beijing used its dominance over the critical materials to pressure the US administration.

In April, in response to escalating trade tensions, including US tariffs, Beijing imposed export restrictions on seven rare earths and permanent magnets, with companies needing to secure special licenses to send these materials overseas. The curbs included some heavy rare earths, which are almost exclusively produced by China. This was the first time China has placed rare earth magnets on the export control list.

The global automotive industry was among the sectors significantly affected by China's export controls on rare earth magnets. Ford Motor temporarily shut a Chicago factory in May after running short of rare-earth components. In the European Union, companies also reported several production stoppages.

Then, October saw sweeping new restrictions with Beijing outlining plans to expand curbs, including requiring overseas exporters of items that contain even small amounts of certain rare earths sourced from China to have an export license. It also subjected technology and equipment related to rare earths processing and magnets to export controls. These measures will now be suspended for a year. The original restrictions announced in April, targeting seven heavy rare earths, weren't addressed in the statement following this week's meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

The US accounted for 10% of China's total rare earth exports in 2024, but restrictions have led to a 12% drop in shipments to the US from the first to the third quarter of 2025.

How will the US boost production of rare earths?

MP Materials operates the only American rare earths mine - Mountain Pass in California's Mojave Desert, reopened in 2018, and once the world's top supplier before production shifted to China. It received a $400 million investment from the Pentagon in July, which helped the company fund a new magnets plant in a deal that came with guaranteed purchases at minimum prices.

Trump is also looking beyond the US for rare earths supplies.

Earlier this month, the US and Australia agreed to jointly invest in Australian mines and processing projects. Both countries also pledged to protect their domestic markets from "unfair trade practices", using trade measures like floor prices. Australia ranks fourth in rare earth reserves. Still, most projects are several years away from becoming operational.

The US President has also sealed a series of deals on his Asia trip to secure rare earth supplies, including deals with Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia.

The deal with Japan involves the two sides agreeing to boost the supply and production of rare earths, including plans for coordinated investment and stockpiling of rare earths. Meanwhile, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia all agreed to increase US access to rare earths and export rules that would favour American buyers over Chinese companies. These include promises that they will not block shipments to the US. They would also encourage local processing and investment by non-Chinese firms.

These deals mark progress towards more diversified supply chains of rare earths, marking a shift in approach, increasing support and involvement from the state.

Rising demand adds urgency

The rise in demand from EVs, renewable energy, and defence adds urgency to the market. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects strong growth in rare earth demand driven by clean energy technologies. EVs are expected to lead, with a compound annual growth rate of 17.2% from 2024 to 2030, followed by wind turbines at 7.5%. Overall, rare earth demand is forecast to grow at 5.1% annually during this period. Other end uses include defence, mobile phones, displays, medical imaging, speakers, headphones, control rods in nuclear reactors and catalysts.

Loosening China's grip on rare earths won't be easy

The deal between Trump and Xi should not give policymakers a false sense of security. Instead, it must serve as a reminder that the United States urgently needs to accelerate efforts to build a supply chain for critical minerals and magnets that does not depend on China. Beijing's dominance means it can tighten export restrictions at any time.

In the near term, China will likely maintain its edge, thanks to technical expertise, low costs, and an extensive supply network. But rare earth supply chains must diversify. International cooperation and investment are essential first steps.

Breaking Beijing's grip on rare earths will be slow and expensive, but the payoff is strategic independence. Export controls that give China leverage today will ultimately spur global efforts to develop non-Chinese supply chains. The more the world invests in onshoring and alternative suppliers, the less control China will wield in the long run.

## 42. Trump says US tariffs on China cut by 10% immediately

**Full Text:**

US President Donald Trump said Oct. 30 that he has cut the 20% fentanyl-related tariffs on China by 10%, effective immediately, following a summit meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea, in a move that could potentially affect China's commodity trade with the US.

Trump said that China will begin "buying in very large quantities of soybeans and other things" from the US.

"I've agreed, as you know, I put a 20% tariff on China because of the fentanyl coming in, which I said is a big tariff," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Washington.

"And based on his statements today, I reduced it by 10%. So it's 10% instead of 20% effective immediately," he said.

Trump said Oct. 29 that he had expected to lower the fentanyl-related tariffs, as fentanyl would be one of the agenda items in his meeting with Xi on Oct. 30.

This signal from the US president could potentially de-escalate the tit-for-tat tariff conflict that began in February, after the second Trump administration imposed an initial 10% tariff on Chinese goods, citing the fentanyl crisis as a "national emergency."

In response to the US' imposition of fentanyl-related tariffs in February, China swiftly retaliated with countermeasures, including a 15% tariff on US LNG and coal and a 10% tariff on US crude oil and agricultural machinery. The US then raised the fentanyl-related tariff to 20% in March, prompting another round of Chinese retaliatory tariffs on US agricultural products such as soybeans, pork and wheat.

If the US proceeds with lowering these tariffs, it could prompt China to reciprocate by reducing its own tariffs on US LNG, which currently faces a 25% levy -- comprising a 15% counter-fentanyl tariff and a 10% reciprocal tariff -- market sources said Oct. 29.

China has suspended LNG imports from the US for nearly eight months, since early February, a direct consequence of the US-China tariff dispute, according to Chinese customs data and shipping figures from S&P Global Commodity Insights.

**Full Text:**

GYEONGJU, South Korea (AP) -- Leaders of 21 Asian and Pacific Rim nations are to set to wrap up their annual economic forum on Saturday after President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed on a temporary truce on their trade war, generating relief around the world.

This year's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in the South Korean city of Gyeongju was heavily overshadowed by Thursday's Trump-Xi meeting that ended with the two leaders dialing back their earlier trade steps and de-escalating their trade tensions.

The high-stakes meeting was arranged on the sidelines of APEC. Trump, known for his dismissal of multilateralism, quickly left South Korea after reaching deals with Xi, allowing the Chinese president to steal the limelight at the summit.

During the APEC summit's opening session Friday, Xi said China would support global free trade and supply chain stability in an apparent effort to position his country as an alternative to Trump's protectionist policies. In written remarks sent to a CEO summit held in conjunction with APEC, Xi said that "Investing in China is investing in the future."

Xi met his Japanese, Canadian and Thai counterparts bilaterally on the sidelines of APEC on Friday. He's to meet South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Saturday for talks that Seoul officials said would touch on efforts to achieve denuclearization and peace on the Korean Peninsula.

That agenda at the Xi-Lee meeting angered North Korea, a non-APEC member. North Korea's Vice Foreign Minister Pak Myong Ho on Saturday slammed South Korea for talking about "its daydream" of realizing North Korea's denuclearization, saying North Korea will show how such a push is "a pipedream" that can never be realized. Park's statement was seen as applying pressure on both South Korea and China ahead of their bilateral summit.

Trump earlier repeatedly expressed his desire to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong U n during his visit to South Korea, but North Korea hasn't responded. Trump and Kim met three times in 2018-19, but their nuclear diplomacy eventually collapsed. North Korea has since vowed not to place its advancing nuclear program on a negotiating table, but experts say the North would aim for winning extensive sanctions relief in return for a partial surrender of its advancing nuclear program.

Friday's APEC meeting focused on ways to boost trade and investment, and Saturday's meeting is expected to center on artificial intelligence, demographic challenges and new growth strategies.

As the host nation, South Korea has been prodding members to adopt a joint declaration at the end of APEC's second and final day session on Saturday. In a 2018 APEC summit in Papua New Guinea, members failed to come up with a joint declaration due to U.S.-China discord over trade.

South Korean officials earlier said that issuing a joint statement strongly endorsing free trade would be unlikely because of differing positions among APEC members

Established in 1989, APEC champions free and open trade and investment to accelerate regional economic integration. But the APEC region now faces challenges like strategic rivalry between the U.S. and China, supply chain disruptions, aging populations and the impact of AI on jobs.

The U.S. strategy has been shifted to economic competitions with China rather than cooperation, with Trump's tariff hikes and "America first" agenda shaking markets and threatening decades of globalization and multinationalism.

## 48. Nvidia uncertain if return to China is closer after Trump-Xi meeting

**Full Text:**

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed uncertainty about resuming advanced chip sales in China following the Trump-Xi meeting. Despite discussions on semiconductors, the U.S. government's role as "referee" and China's market closure have left Nvidia's business in China at zero. Huang hopes for new policies to re-enter the Chinese market amid soaring AI demand.

Jensen Huang, the head of Nvidia, said again Friday that he was eager for the Silicon Valley chipmaking giant to resume selling advanced semiconductors in China but expressed uncertainty about whether this week's meeting between President Donald Trump and China's top leader, Xi Jinping, brought the company any closer to achieving that goal.

Huang arrived in South Korea shortly after the face-to-face summit of the two leaders in the country Thursday. Trump told reporters that the leaders discussed semiconductors without addressing Nvidia's most advanced artificial intelligence technology. He added that Chinese officials would talk to Nvidia about "taking chips," with the United States playing "referee."

The remarks created confusion because Trump had suggested before the meeting that he would discuss Nvidia's most powerful AI semiconductors with Xi, fueling speculation that the United States might ease restrictions limiting access to the technology.

"I don't have any new insight from the meeting," Huang said at a news conference on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit Friday. "I hope that we will have new policies that allow Nvidia to go back into China, for China to welcome Nvidia back."

Amid skyrocketing demand for technology infrastructure to power AI systems, access to Nvidia's chips has become a national security issue. Nvidia has been thrust into the middle of the economic feud between China and the United States.

Before Trump came into office, the U.S. government had already imposed rules to limit the sales of Nvidia's most powerful chips in China. The Trump administration initially banned exports of Nvidia's H20 chip, a downgraded version of the company's Hopper chips, which were made particularly for China. It reversed that decision in July, when Trump said the

H20 chip could be sold and that the federal government would take a 15% cut of that revenue.

But before Nvidia could move forward, China closed off the company's access to its market. In July, China's internet regulator summoned Nvidia to explain security risks associated with one of its chips. Beijing also discouraged Chinese companies from using the H20 chip, pushing them to try domestic alternatives.

Huang said Nvidia's business in China is now at "zero," after once holding almost total market share.

## 49. Canada's other superpower problem

**Full Text:**

The bond between the two nations has been frayed by bitter acrimony and mistrust on both sides.

As poor as Canada's relations with the United States have been under President Donald Trump, they are even worse with the world's other superpower, China.

The bond between the two nations has been frayed by bitter acrimony and mistrust on both sides.

Canadian citizens have been used as pawns by China, its top leader publicly humiliated a former Canadian prime minister, and the two countries are locked in a brutal tariff war. A recent poll showed that the only nation Canadians generally trust less than the United States is China.

Now there is cautious optimism around the first formal meeting since 2017 between the two nations' leaders.

That a meeting between Prime Minister Mark Carney and Xi Jinping is even taking place is an example of how Trump's global tariff campaign and unpredictable diplomacy have forced a once close U.S. ally to look to China.

"Trump is the invisible presence in every meeting between two leaders in the world today," said Roland Paris, an international relations professor at the University of Ottawa. "For Canada, the primary overriding imperative is managing our relations with the United States, our closest trading partner.''

"But if it's possible to achieve relief on the Chinese tariffs," he added, "then that would be a great thing."

Still, there is reason for tempering expectations for the meeting scheduled for Friday in Gyeongju, South Korea, where both leaders are attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.

When Justin Trudeau, a Liberal, became prime minister in 2015, relations between the countries had been tense because of persistent criticism of China's human rights record by the previous Conservative government.

Trudeau made improving the relationship a top priority, but a series of events made it even worse.

In 2018, a top Chinese telecommunications executive was arrested in British Columbia under an extradition request from the United States, and then, days after, China imprisoned two Canadians. All three were released in what effectively amounted to a prisoner swap, but the episode remains a source of deep anger in Canada.

In 2022, Xi scolded Trudeau in front of a news cameraman at a reception in Indonesia, accusing him of leaking details of a brief conversation they had at an earlier reception. The exchange resembled an encounter between a stern schoolmaster and a pupil.

This year a Canadian inquiry found evidence of election meddling in Canada by China, though there was no evidence that it successfully influenced the outcomes of any votes.

More recently, China applied tariffs of up to 100% on canola, an oil seed that accounted for about 5 billion Canadian dollars (about $3.6 billion) in sales last year, making it Canada's most valuable agricultural export to China.

China went after canola after Canada imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles.

Despite the bad feelings, some experts believe there is room to move in a more productive direction.

"The world has changed quite dramatically compared to, let's say, six months ago," said Lynette Ong, a political scientist and Asian specialist at the University of Toronto.

Aside from Trump's wave of tariffs, the most significant change, she said, is the stalling Chinese economy, which is forcing Xi to reevaluate his country's external relations.

"When the economy was far stronger, he had sour relations with a bunch of countries -- he did not care and he could afford to do so," she said. "Now they need to drive exports for economic recovery."

Wang Di, the Chinese ambassador to Canada, recently said in a social media post that ending the electric vehicle tariffs would "usher in the spring of improvement" in bilateral relations. Wang, in an interview with Canadian television, said such a move would prompt China to drop its levies on canola.

Carney is also facing pressure at home. Two premiers in provinces that produce canola have asked the government to drop the electric vehicle tariff.

Canada has effectively shut out electric vehicles made in China after heavy campaigning by automakers in Detroit and Unifor, the union that represents Canadian workers.

But the tariff is protecting companies that have been withering for years, said Greig Mordue, a professor at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, and former general manager of Toyota's Canadian factories.

This month automaker Stellantis moved production of a Jeep vehicle from a Canadian factory to the United States, leaving the suburban Toronto plant's fate uncertain. And General Motors discontinued production of an electric van, leaving a second Ontario auto plant dark.

"General Motors used to build 1.2 million vehicles or so a year in this country as recently as 20 years ago," Mordue said. "And now they're down to 100,000."

Today, about three-quarters of cars made in Canada come out of factories owned by Toyota and Honda, both Japanese automakers.

Mordue said that Canada could better sustain its auto industry through copying its policy for Japanese carmakers: gradually eliminating tariffs on Chinese vehicles if Chinese companies build plants in Canada and start producing an increasing number of cars.

Still, Canada will need to calibrate its approach to making the country more welcoming to Chinese imports. Pursuing that route would risk more backlash from Trump because of the intense global competition between the United States and China.

"The window is opening a bit and that's up to the government of Canada to figure out if they're prepared to try to pry that window open a little bit more and deal with the inevitable outcome," Mordue said.

Xu Yanzhou, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told Chinese media that a major pivot by Canada toward China was unlikely because of its long-standing security dependence on the United States as well as fears of retaliation from the Trump administration.

Ottawa's "defensiveness toward China remains prominent," she said, "and their stance on core sensitive areas has not fundamentally shifted."

Xi may well have other issues to raise at the meeting. Canada has used foreign investment laws to reject takeovers of Canadian companies, particularly in natural resources, as a national security concern.

Still, China's human rights record and its effort to undermine democracies will limit what Carney could offer.

"It is a fraught challenge trying to find a basis on which to trade with a country with whom you disagree with in some fundamental ways," said Stewart Prest, a political scientist at the University of British Columbia. "Yet the fact remains that both countries can benefit economically and politically as well from finding a common cause on which to work."

As he left Malaysia, the first stop on a weeklong tour of Asia, Carney noted that his talks with China were "starting from a very low base" and suggested that was a plus.

"There's no preset offer," Carney said. "This is the difference between relationship and transaction. We're starting a relationship, building up the relationship."

**Full Text:**

WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump reaffirmed on Friday that the U.S. would resume nuclear testing, but he did not answer directly when asked whether that would include underground nuclear tests that were common during the Cold War.

"You'll find out very soon, but we're going to do some testing," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew to Palm Beach, Florida, when asked about underground nuclear tests.

"Other countries do it. If they're (going) to do it, we're going to do it, OK?"

Trump on Thursday said he ordered the U.S. military to immediately restart the process for testing nuclear weapons after a halt of 33 years, a move that appeared to be a message to rival nuclear powers China and Russia.

Trump made that surprise announcement on social media while aboard his Marine One helicopter flying to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping for a trade-negotiating session in Busan, South Korea.

It was not immediately clear whether Trump was referring to nuclear-explosive testing, which would be carried out by the National Nuclear Security Administration, or flight testing of nuclear-capable missiles.

During a trip to Malaysia, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said resuming testing was a "very responsible way" to maintain nuclear deterrence, adding that the Pentagon would work with the Department of Energy.

"We're moving out quickly," Hegseth said.

No nuclear power - other than North Korea most recently in 2017 - has carried out explosive nuclear testing in over 25 years.- Reuters
